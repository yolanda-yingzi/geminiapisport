It is a normal reaction to stress. Anxiety can help you stay alert for a challenging situation at work, study harder for an exam, or remain focused on an important speech. In general, it helps you cope. When it becomes hard to control and affects your day-to-day life, it can be disabling.\\xa0\\nWhat is an anxiety disorder?\\nAnxiety disorders happen when excessive anxiety interferes with your everyday activities such as going to work or school or spending time with friends or family. Anxiety disorders are serious mental illnesses.\\xa0\\nAnxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in the United States. They affect up to 40 million American adults each year. Women are more than twice as likely as men to develop an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, yet less than 37% of those suffering is treated.\\nWhat are the major types of anxiety disorders?\\xa0\\nThere are several major types of anxiety disorders. They all have their own traits and impact people in distinct ways.\\xa0\\n\\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) causes excessive worry about regular aspects of life, like family or income. It can happen daily and make it hard to get through the day or sleep at night.\\xa0\\nPanic disorder involves frequent and sudden panic attacks, which are unexpected feelings of terror that happen without warning. Panic attacks can occur when there is no direct danger.\\nPhobias are a strong fear of something of little to no threat. This can include traveling by air or being around a large group of people.\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?\\nAnxiety disorders come with a mix of symptoms. They can vary by person and the type of anxiety disorder you have. Symptoms can also impact how you live and spend time with others.\\nThere are many symptoms of anxiety. The symptoms below are shared across several types of anxiety disorders:\\n\\nAnxious thoughts or beliefs\\nFeelings of fear and dread\\nPhysical symptoms like a fast heartbeat or nausea\\nChanges in behavior like avoiding previous normal activities\\xa0\\n\\nWhat causes anxiety disorders?\\nSeveral factors can cause anxiety disorder. They can vary from one woman to another. A few common causes include:\\n\\nTraumatic events in childhood or adulthood\\nHormonal changes during one’s menstrual cycle\\nA family history of anxiety or other mental disorders\\n\\nWhat are common treatment options?\\nFor some people, treatment can help ease anxiety symptoms. There are several types of treatments for anxiety available to help you manage your symptoms every day, such as:\\xa0\\nCounseling (psychotherapy or talk therapy)\\n\\nThis form of treatment includes talking with a trained mental health professional. Together, you can work through managing your anxiety.\\n\\nMedicine\\n\\nMedicine does not cure anxiety disorders but can help relieve symptoms. Health care providers can prescribe medicines for anxiety. The most common classes of medicines used to combat anxiety disorders are antidepressants, anti-anxiety medicines (such as benzodiazepines), and beta-blockers.\\n\\nTalk with your health care provider to find out what treatment is right for you. You should also talk with your provider about the risks, benefits, and side effects before you start or stop a medical treatment.\\n \\n\\nHow does my physical health affect my mental health?\\nPeople who are not physically healthy may have trouble staying mentally healthy. People living with chronic (long-term) health problems such as diabetes or heart disease are often more likely to have higher levels of stress and anxiety. Having a chronic disease does not always mean you will have a mental health condition like an anxiety disorder, but if you are struggling with both, know that you are not alone. Support groups and health care professionals can help. Healthy eating and other healthy habits, like exercise, yoga, or meditation can help improve physical health and reduce anxiety.\\nWhat should you do if you think you have an anxiety disorder?\\n\\nSet up a visit to see a health care provider. At this visit, your primary care doctor will conduct an initial mental health screening. From there, they can refer you to a mental health specialist.\\n\\n\\nGet involved in your care. Be open about your symptoms and listen to your options. Give your input on the options you feel could be a good fit for you.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTurn to people you trust for support. As you navigate life with an anxiety disorder, it helps to have people in your life that you trust. Find friends and support groups that you know will listen to your concerns and help you through tough times.\\xa0\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nCall or text the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 if you have immediate concerns about your mental health. The Lifeline provides 24/7, free and confidential support for people in distress, and prevention and crisis resources for you or your loved ones in the United States. Call 911 if you or someone you know is in immediate danger or go to the nearest emergency room.\\xa0\\n\\nWhat do you need to know about anxiety disorders and pregnancy?\\nIf you are thinking about becoming pregnant, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding, you should talk with your health care provider about any medicines you may take for anxiety.
