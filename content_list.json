It is a normal reaction to stress. Anxiety can help you stay alert for a challenging situation at work, study harder for an exam, or remain focused on an important speech. In general, it helps you cope. When it becomes hard to control and affects your day-to-day life, it can be disabling. \nWhat is an anxiety disorder?\nAnxiety disorders happen when excessive anxiety interferes with your everyday activities such as going to work or school or spending time with friends or family. Anxiety disorders are serious mental illnesses. \nAnxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in the United States. They affect up to 40 million American adults each year. Women are more than twice as likely as men to develop an anxiety disorder in their lifetime. Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, yet less than 37% of those suffering is treated.\nWhat are the major types of anxiety disorders? \nThere are several major types of anxiety disorders. They all have their own traits and impact people in distinct ways. \n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) causes excessive worry about regular aspects of life, like family or income. It can happen daily and make it hard to get through the day or sleep at night. \nPanic disorder involves frequent and sudden panic attacks, which are unexpected feelings of terror that happen without warning. Panic attacks can occur when there is no direct danger.\nPhobias are a strong fear of something of little to no threat. This can include traveling by air or being around a large group of people.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?\nAnxiety disorders come with a mix of symptoms. They can vary by person and the type of anxiety disorder you have. Symptoms can also impact how you live and spend time with others.\nThere are many symptoms of anxiety. The symptoms below are shared across several types of anxiety disorders:\n\nAnxious thoughts or beliefs\nFeelings of fear and dread\nPhysical symptoms like a fast heartbeat or nausea\nChanges in behavior like avoiding previous normal activities \n\nWhat causes anxiety disorders?\nSeveral factors can cause anxiety disorder. They can vary from one woman to another. A few common causes include:\n\nTraumatic events in childhood or adulthood\nHormonal changes during one’s menstrual cycle\nA family history of anxiety or other mental disorders\n\nWhat are common treatment options?\nFor some people, treatment can help ease anxiety symptoms. There are several types of treatments for anxiety available to help you manage your symptoms every day, such as: \nCounseling (psychotherapy or talk therapy)\n\nThis form of treatment includes talking with a trained mental health professional. Together, you can work through managing your anxiety.\n\nMedicine\n\nMedicine does not cure anxiety disorders but can help relieve symptoms. Health care providers can prescribe medicines for anxiety. The most common classes of medicines used to combat anxiety disorders are antidepressants, anti-anxiety medicines (such as benzodiazepines), and beta-blockers.\n\nTalk with your health care provider to find out what treatment is right for you. You should also talk with your provider about the risks, benefits, and side effects before you start or stop a medical treatment.\n \n\nHow does my physical health affect my mental health?\nPeople who are not physically healthy may have trouble staying mentally healthy. People living with chronic (long-term) health problems such as diabetes or heart disease are often more likely to have higher levels of stress and anxiety. Having a chronic disease does not always mean you will have a mental health condition like an anxiety disorder, but if you are struggling with both, know that you are not alone. Support groups and health care professionals can help. Healthy eating and other healthy habits, like exercise, yoga, or meditation can help improve physical health and reduce anxiety.\nWhat should you do if you think you have an anxiety disorder?\n\nSet up a visit to see a health care provider. At this visit, your primary care doctor will conduct an initial mental health screening. From there, they can refer you to a mental health specialist.\n\n\nGet involved in your care. Be open about your symptoms and listen to your options. Give your input on the options you feel could be a good fit for you. \n\n\nTurn to people you trust for support. As you navigate life with an anxiety disorder, it helps to have people in your life that you trust. Find friends and support groups that you know will listen to your concerns and help you through tough times. \n\n \n\n\nCall or text the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 if you have immediate concerns about your mental health. The Lifeline provides 24/7, free and confidential support for people in distress, and prevention and crisis resources for you or your loved ones in the United States. Call 911 if you or someone you know is in immediate danger or go to the nearest emergency room. \n\nWhat do you need to know about anxiety disorders and pregnancy?\nIf you are thinking about becoming pregnant, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding, you should talk with your health care provider about any medicines you may take for anxiety. Some medicines can affect your unborn baby, but untreated mental health conditions can also affect an unborn baby. Some medicines may also pass to your baby through breast milk. Talk with your provider about what treatments are safe for you and your baby.\nDuring pregnancy or as a new mother, you may feel overwhelmed at times. Mental health support and resources are available through the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline. It is free, confidential, and available 24/7. Call or text 1-833- TLC-MAMA (1-833-852-6262). \nTalk with your health care provider about all medical treatment options. Discuss their risks and benefits. Your provider can answer all your questions. Together, you can decide which treatment is right for you.\nDiverse Women in Clinical Trials campaign \nClinical trials are research studies that inform the safety of new treatments. This includes medications that treat anxiety. It is important that women of diverse backgrounds take part in clinical trials. It can lead to more treatment options that work for all women. Learn more about women in clinical trials.\nThis information was developed by the FDA Office of Women’s Health.

Read the product label and talk with your health care provider for more information on the risks of a specific product or on the chance of getting pregnant while using a contraceptive. \n\t\n\nThe FDA regulates birth control products that are medical devices or drugs. The FDA approves, clears, and grants marketing authorization to such birth control (contraceptive) products when they are shown to be both safe and effective (work well to prevent pregnancy). \nThe birth control webpage and printable PDF chart provide high-level information about different birth control options. The webpage and chart are meant for educational purposes for the general public. They are not a complete list of all available birth control options. Talk with your health care provider about the best birth control choice for you.\nIf you do not want to get pregnant, there are many birth control options to choose from. No one product is best for everyone. Some contraceptives are better than others at preventing pregnancy. The only sure way to avoid pregnancy is to not have sex.\nTypes of birth control\n\nPermanent sterilization\nLong-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC)\nContraceptive injection/shot\nShort-acting hormonal contraceptives\nSoftware application for contraception\nBarrier contraceptives\nEmergency contraception (EC)\n\nSome things to think about when you choose birth control:\n\nYour health.\nIf you want to have children in the future.\nHow often you have sex.\nHow many sexual partners you have.\nIf you will need a prescription or if you can buy the contraceptive over-the-counter.\n\nThis page lists pregnancy rates based on the number of pregnancies expected per 100 women who use a method of contraception for one year. For comparison, about 85 out of 100 sexually active women who do not use any birth control can expect to become pregnant in a year. These pregnancy rates can help you understand how effective the different methods are during actual use (including sometimes using a method in a way that is not correct or not consistent).\nFor more information on the chance of getting pregnant while using a method of contraception or on the risks of a specific product, please check the product labeling or references such as Bradley SEK, et al., Effectiveness, safety, and comparative side effects. In: Cason P, Cwiak C, Edelment A, et al. [Eds.] Contraceptive Technology. 22nd edition. Burlington, MA: Jones-Bartlett Learning, 2023.\nTell your doctor, health care provider, or pharmacist if you:\n\nSmoke.\nHave liver disease.\nHave blood clots or family members who have had blood clots.\nHave had a stroke or heart attack or have vascular disease.\nHave migraines.\nAre taking any other medicines, like antibiotics or daily prescription medicines.\nAre taking any herbal products, like St. John’s Wort.\nAre breastfeeding.\nHave been pregnant or recently given birth.\nHave abnormal uterine bleeding.\nHave breast cancer.\n\nTo avoid pregnancy:\n\nNo matter which contraceptive you choose, it is important to follow all of the directions carefully. If you do not, you increase your chance of getting pregnant.\nThe best way to avoid pregnancy is to not have sex.\n\n\n\nPermanent sterilization\nSterilization surgery for women (also called trans-abdominal surgical sterilization)\nSterilization surgery is for women who are sure they never want to have a child or do not want any more children. Sterilization surgery may not be right for you if you are uncertain about not having children or having any more children. Sometimes it is possible to reverse the sterilization. Reversal involves another surgery that might not be successful. \n \n\nWhat is it?\n\nThis is a surgery a woman needs only once.\nIt is permanent.\nOne way is by tying and cutting the fallopian tubes — this is called tubal ligation.\nThe fallopian tubes also can be sealed using an instrument with an electrical current.\nThey also can be closed with clips, clamps, or rings.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe fallopian tubes are blocked so the egg and sperm cannot meet in the fallopian tube. This stops you from getting pregnant.\n\nHow do I get it?\n\nThis is surgery.\nYou will need general anesthesia.\n\nChance of getting pregnant with use (number of pregnancies expected in one year per 100 women who use this method of contraception)\n\nOut of 100 women who use have this surgery, less than 1 may get pregnant.\n\nSome risks\n\nBleeding\nInfection or other complications after surgery\nPain\n\n\nDoes it provide protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? No. \n\n\nSterilization surgery for men (vasectomy)\nSterilization surgery is for men who are sure they never want to have a child or do not want any more children. Vasectomy may not be right for you if you are uncertain about not having children or having any more children. Sometimes it is possible to reverse the operation, but the likelihood of a successful reversal decreases as more time passes between vasectomy and reversal. Reversal involves complicated surgery that might not work.\n \n\nWhat is it?\n\nThis is a surgery a man needs only once.\nIt is permanent.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe surgery blocks a man’s vas deferens (the tubes that carry sperm from the testes).\nAfter this surgery, the semen (the fluid that comes out of a man’s penis) has no sperm in it.\nIt takes about three months to clear sperm out of a man’s system. You will need to use another form of birth control until a test shows there is no longer any sperm in the seminal fluid.\n\nHow do I get it?\n\nThis is surgery.\nLocal anesthesia is used.\n\nChance of getting pregnant with use (number of pregnancies expected in one year per 100 women whose partner uses this method of contraception)\n\nOut of 100 women whose partner has had a vasectomy, less than 1 may get pregnant.\n\nSome risks\n\nBleeding\nInfection\nPain\n\nThe success of reversal surgery depends on:\n\nThe length of time since the vasectomy was performed.\nWhether or not antibodies to sperm have developed.\nThe surgical method used for vasectomy.\nThe length and location of the segments of vas deferens that were removed or blocked.\n\n\nDoes it provide protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? No.\n\n\nLong-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC)\nThese contraceptives last for several years. If you want to get pregnant, you can stop using them at any time. A health care professional removes a LARC so you can get pregnant. \n\n\nIUD or IUS (intrauterine device or intrauterine system) without hormone (copper)\n \n\nWhat is it? \n\nA T-shaped device containing copper put into the uterus by a health care provider\n\nHow does it work? \n\nThe IUD prevents sperm from reaching the egg, from fertilizing the egg, and may prevent the egg from attaching (implanting) in the womb (uterus).\nIt does not stop the ovaries from making an egg (ovulating) each month.\nThe IUD can be used for up to 10 years.\nAfter the IUD is taken out, it is possible to get pregnant.\n\nHow do I get it?\n\nAn IUD is put into the uterus by a health care provider.\n\nChance of getting pregnant with use (number of pregnancies expected per 100 women who use this method of contraception for one year)\n\nOut of 100 women who use this contraceptive, less than 1 may get pregnant.\n\nSome side effects\n\nCramps\nHeavier, longer periods, or spotting between periods\n\nSome less common risks\n\nEctopic pregnancy (a pregnancy outside of the uterus) \nExpulsion - the IUD is no longer in the uterus and therefore there is no pregnancy protection\nPelvic inflammatory disease\nSevere infection\nUterine perforation\n\nDoes it provide protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?

        "topic": "Cholesterol Medicines",
        "content": "Cholesterol Medicines\n \n\nPrint and Share (PDF 2496KB)\nCholesterol is a kind of fat in your blood. Your body makes its own cholesterol, but you also get it from the foods you eat, such as meat; foods fried in animal fat, like lard, butter, or margarine; dairy products; or other foods.\nMost people do not show any signs of high cholesterol. The only way to know your cholesterol levels for sure is to ask your healthcare provider for a cholesterol test. A cholesterol test can tell you about your:\n\nLDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol: LDL is commonly called “bad” cholesterol. LDL can clog your arteries, and high LDL levels may make you more likely to have a heart event, such as a heart attack or stroke. A healthy LDL blood level is less than 100 mg/dL.\nHDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol: HDL is sometimes called “good” cholesterol. People with high HDL blood levels may be less likely to have a heart event. A healthy HDL blood level is 60 mg/dL or higher.\nTotal Cholesterol (TC): TC includes LDL, HDL, and other kinds of cholesterol. A healthy TC is less than 200 mg/dL.\nTriglycerides: Triglycerides are another type of fat measured as part of the cholesterol test. Triglyceride levels lower than 150 mg/dL are healthy. High triglycerides may increase your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. People with very high triglyceride levels (500 mg/dL or higher) are at risk for other health problems. Very high triglyceride levels are discussed in a separate section below.\n\nHigh Cholesterol Levels\nSome people have too much cholesterol in their blood. Cholesterol can build up on the inside of the blood vessels in your heart as well as other blood vessels in your body. If too much cholesterol builds up in the blood vessels in your heart, the blood cannot flow through to your heart and may lead to a heart attack. People with high cholesterol, especially high LDL, are more likely to have a heart event, such as a heart attack or stroke, or need surgery or a procedure to open up the blood vessels of the heart (bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stent placement).\nA heart-healthy lifestyle may help lower your cholesterol and your chance of having a heart event at all ages. A heart-healthy lifestyle includes reducing the amount of total and saturated fat in your diet, participating in regular aerobic exercise, and losing weight (if you are overweight or obese).\nLowering LDL with certain medicines may decrease your chance of having a heart event. But not everyone with high cholesterol needs medicine. Whether or not you should start a cholesterol-lowering medicine depends on a few things: if you already have heart (cardiovascular) disease, your age, your cholesterol levels, and other factors. Your healthcare provider can help you decide about taking a cholesterol-lowering medicine, such as a statin.\nIn most cases, if you need to take a cholesterol-lowering medicine, your healthcare provider may consider prescribing a statin first. You can discuss this more with your healthcare provider.\nVery High Triglyceride Levels (Severe Hypertriglyceridemia)\nPeople with very high triglyceride levels (500 mg/dL or higher) may be more likely to develop acute pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is swelling and irritation of the pancreas that feels like sudden, severe stomach pain. In some cases, the pain may get better, but in other cases you could have a fever, severe dehydration, and get very sick and need to go to the hospital for care to save your life. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones, excess alcohol use, and taking certain medicines. Very high triglycerides may cause acute pancreatitis even in people who do not have gallstones or drink alcohol.\nMany things can cause very high triglyceride levels, such as genetic causes (passed down from a parent), uncontrolled diabetes, taking certain medicines, being obese or overweight, alcohol use, pregnancy, and thyroid disease. People with high triglycerides should follow a low-fat diet with a goal of weight loss (if overweight or obese) and should not drink alcohol or take certain medicines. People with diabetes are typically instructed to follow a meal plan and take their diabetes medicine as prescribed to improve control of their blood sugar levels.\nSome people may need to take medicine in addition to lifestyle changes (diet and exercise) to lower their triglyceride levels. If you have high triglyceride levels, you should talk to your healthcare provider.\n\nMedicines to Control Cholesterol and Triglycerides\nThere are different kinds of medicines to lower high cholesterol, triglycerides, or both.\n\nHMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (also called statins)\nCholesterol Absorption Inhibitors\nProprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin Type 9 (also called PCSK9 inhibitors)\nAdenosine Triphosphate-Citrate Lyase (ACL) Inhibitors\nCholesterol-Lowering Combination Medicines\nHigh Blood Pressure and Cholesterol-Lowering Combination Medicines\nOmega-3-Acid Ethyl Esters\nBile Acid Sequestrants\nFibric Acid Derivatives (also called fibrates)\nNiacin\n\nUse this information as a guide to help you talk with your healthcare provider about your cholesterol or triglyceride medicine. Ask your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of taking your medicine. This information only talks about some of the risks.\nTell your healthcare provider about any problems you are having. Your healthcare provider will help you find the medicine that is best for you.\nAlso, tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant. Ask your healthcare provider to tell you about the benefits and risks of taking medicine when you are pregnant.\nThe different kinds of cholesterol and triglyceride medicines are listed below. The medicines are listed in groups. The brand names and generic names are given for the medicines in each group. \nFor the most complete and up-to-date information about the risks and side effects for each medicine, check Drugs@FDA.\n\nHMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (also called Statins)\n\n\n\nGeneric Name\nBrand Name\n\n\n\n\natorvastin\nLipitor\n\n\nfluvastatin\nLescol XL\n\n\nlovastatin\nAltoprev\n\n\npravastatin\nPravachol\n\n\npitavastatin\nLivalo and Zypitamag\n\n\nrosuvastatin\nCrestor and Ezallor Sprinkles\n\n\nsimvastatin\nFlolipid and Zocor\n\n\n\nStatins: What You Should Know\nThese medicines treat high cholesterol and high triglycerides.

These problems can include heart attack, stroke, or other heart problems requiring hospitalization (including congestive heart failure). Certain statins may reduce the risk of or need for heart procedures, such as bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stent placement.

Women are more likely than men to feel depressed, although it is a major problem for both sexes.\nThere is hope.\nDepression can be treated with medicine or counseling. Sometimes both are used. Talk to your healthcare provider to find out what will work best for you. \nUse the following information to help you talk to your healthcare provider about medicines called antidepressants that can help treat depression. The medicine charts list FDA-approved products that are available to treat this condition.

Other women notice that their depression gets worse during pregnancy. \nNo one knows the exact cause of depression during or after pregnancy. It may have something to do with: \n\nStress and sleep problems \nHormones - after a woman has a baby, her hormone levels drop quickly \nHaving depression before you get pregnant\nLack of support from family and friends \nYoung age – the younger you are when you have your baby the more likely you are to become depressed\n\nWomen should talk to their healthcare provider about the risks of taking antidepressants during pregnancy and after the baby’s birth.\nDepression can make it hard for a woman to take care of herself and her baby. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about your feelings. Also, try to get some help from your family, friends, or a support group. \n\nAsk a relative to watch your baby for a few hours. \nJoin a group for new mothers. \nAsk a friend to cook a meal for your family or to help with chores.\n\n\n\n\n“The Baby Blues”\nHaving a baby can be a joyful time.

This is called “the baby blues.” These feelings usually go away after about two weeks.\nIf you still feel sad after two weeks, go to your healthcare provider or clinic. You may be depressed. This type of depression is called postpartum depression because it starts after a woman has a baby. A woman can have this kind of depression up to one year after she has a baby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for a Pregnancy Registry\nPregnancy Exposure Registries are research studies that collect information from women who take prescription medicines or vaccines during pregnancy.\nPregnancy registries can help women and their doctors learn more about how depression medicines affect women during pregnancy.\nThe FDA does not run pregnancy studies, but it keeps a list of registries.

Food illnesses can also cause serious health problems, even death. Follow these four steps to help keep you and your family safe.\n4 basic steps for food safety\n1. Clean: always wash your food, hands, counters, and cooking tools.\n\nWash hands in warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds. Do this before and after touching food.\nWash your cutting boards, dishes, forks, spoons, knives, and counter tops with hot soapy water. Do this after working with each food item.\nRinse fruits and veggies.\nDo not wash meat, poultry, fish, or eggs. If water splashes from the sink in the process of washing, it can spread bacteria.\nClean the lids on canned goods before opening.\n\n2. Separate (keep apart):  keep raw foods to themselves. Germs can spread from one food to another.\n\nKeep raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs away from other foods. Do this in your shopping cart, bags, and fridge.\nDo not reuse marinades used on raw foods unless you bring them to a boil first.\nUse a special cutting board or plate for raw foods only.\n\n3. Cook: foods need to get hot and stay hot. Heat kills germs.\n\nCook to safe temperatures:\n\t\nBeef, Pork, Lamb 145 °F\nFish 145 °F\nGround Beef, Pork, Lamb 160 °F\nTurkey, Chicken, Duck 165 °F\n\n\nUse a food thermometer to make sure that food is done. You can’t always tell by looking.\n\n4. Chill: put food in the fridge right away. \n\n2-Hour Rule: Put foods in the fridge or freezer within 2 hours after cooking or buying from the store. Do this within 1 hour if it is 90 degrees or hotter outside.\nNever thaw food by simply taking it out of the fridge. Thaw food:\n\t\nIn the fridge\nUnder cold water\nIn the microwave\n\n\nMarinate foods in the fridge.\n\n\n\nThink you have a food illness?\nCall your health care provider and get medical care right away.\n\nSave the food package, can, or carton. Then report the problem.\nCall USDA at 1-888-674-6854 if you think the illness was caused by meat, poultry, or eggs.\nCall FDA at 1-866-300-4374 for all other foods.\nCall your local health department if you think you got sick from food you ate in a restaurant or from another food seller.\n\nWho is at risk?\nAnyone can get sick from eating spoiled food. Some people are more likely to get sick from food illnesses.\n\nPregnant women\nOlder adults\nPeople with certain health conditions like cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and kidney disease\n\nSome foods are more risky for these people.

Learn more about your options and use this information to help you talk to your healthcare provider about your blood pressure medicine. You will also find some general information to help you use your medicine wisely.\nHigh blood pressure is a serious illness.\nHigh blood pressure is often called a “silent killer” because you can have it and not know it. You may not feel sick at first. Over time, if you do not get treated for high blood pressure, you can get very sick or even die. \nHigh blood pressure can cause:\n\nKidney failure\nStroke\nBlindness\nHeart attacks\nHeart disease\n\nThere is good news. There are life-saving medicines you can take every day to help control your high blood pressure. If you eat healthy foods, exercise, and take your medicine every day, you can help control your blood pressure.\n\nTake your blood pressure medicine.\nIt is important to take your blood pressure medicine every day. Take your medicine even when your blood pressure comes down... even when you do not feel bad. Do not stop taking your medicine until your healthcare provider says that it is OK.\nMany people who take high blood pressure medicine do not get any side effects. Like all medicines, high blood pressure medicines can sometimes cause side effects. You may have common problems like headaches, dizziness, or an upset stomach. These can be bothersome to how you feel every day but often lessen after the first few weeks of taking the medicine. If you find they continue to be bothersome to you, talk to your healthcare provider.\n\nUnderstanding Your Blood Pressure: What Do the Numbers Mean? \nBlood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is when this force against your artery walls is too high. The higher your blood pressure levels, the more risk you have for other health problems such as heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.\nWhen you have your blood pressure taken, you are told two numbers; for example, 120/80. Both numbers are important. The first (or top) number is your pressure when your heart beats (systolic pressure). The second number is your pressure when your heart relaxes (diastolic pressure). If the measurement reads 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, you would say, “120 over 80.” A normal blood pressure level is usually considered to be less than 120/80.\nTalk with your healthcare provider about your numbers and how you can manage your blood pressure.\nHigh Blood Pressure and Pregnancy\nSome women have high blood pressure during pregnancy. This can put the mother and her baby at risk for problems during the pregnancy and after delivery. High blood pressure sometimes can be severe, which may lead to low birth weight or preterm birth. High blood pressure during pregnancy can raise your risk of high blood pressure in the future.\nThere are different types of high blood pressure during pregnancy.\nGestational hypertension is high blood pressure that you develop while you are pregnant. It starts after you are 20 weeks pregnant. In many cases, gestational hypertension does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. Some women with gestational hypertension develop preeclampsia.\nChronic hypertension is high blood pressure that started before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some women may have had high blood pressure long before becoming pregnant but were unaware until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia. \nPreeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy and may include protein in the urine and very high blood pressure. It usually happens in the last trimester. In rare cases, symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. Preeclampsia may cause damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidneys. Preeclampsia can be serious or even life-threatening for both you and your baby.\nThe most important thing to do is talk with your healthcare provider about any blood pressure problems so you can get the right treatment and control your blood pressure—before you get pregnant. Getting treatment for high blood pressure is important before, during, and after pregnancy to decrease risks to you and your baby.\n\nFor more information about high blood pressure and pregnancy, go to https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/pregnancy.htm.\nTypes of High Blood Pressure Medicines\nYou can use this information to help you talk to your healthcare provider about your blood pressure medicine.\n\nAsk your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of taking your medicine.

Learn the facts. Teach the women in your family and community how to prevent and treat HIV.\nHIV quick facts\nWhat is HIV?\nHIV is the virus that causes AIDS. A person with HIV is called HIV positive (HIV+).\nHIV makes it hard for your body to fight off sickness. There are cells in your blood called 'CD4 cells' or 'T cells'. These cells help protect your body from disease. HIV kills these cells.\nHow do you get HIV?\nHIV is spread through body fluids like blood, semen, or breast milk.\nYou can get HIV when you:\n\nHave sex with a person who is HIV+ and do not use a condom. Most women get HIV from having unprotected sex with a man. You cannot tell who has HIV just by looking at them. Always use a condom every time you have sex.\nShare needles or syringes (drug works) with someone who has HIV\nGet blood from a person who has HIV. Now all donated blood is tested for HIV. You can’t get HIV from giving blood. \n\nYou can’t get HIV from:\n\nShaking hands\nKissing\nSharing household items like forks or glasses with someone who has HIV\n\n\nHIV testing - know your status\nHow do you know if someone has HIV?\nThe only way to know for sure is to get an HIV test. \n\nYou cannot tell who has HIV just by looking at them. Most people do not show any outward signs when they first get HIV.\nA person can spread HIV even if he or she does not look sick.\nKnowing your HIV status gives you the information you need to help you stay healthy.\n\nHow do you get tested for HIV?\nThere are three basic types of HIV tests:\n\nBlood – A small amount of blood is taken from your finger or arm.\nOral – Fluid is taken from the inside of your mouth\nUrine – A small cup of urine is used.\n\nSome HIV tests take 1-2 weeks to get results from a lab. Other tests called “rapid HIV tests” can give results in about 20 minutes.\nYou can get tested at places like a doctor’s office, mobile health van, or health fair. There are also home HIV tests that let you test yourself.\nTo find a testing site near you:\n\nCall 1-800-232-4636\nVisit gettested.cdc.gov\n\nWhat is the “window period”?\nIt may take a few weeks or months for HIV to show up on a test. This time is called the “window period.”\n\nA person who was just infected with HIV may not test positive even though they have the virus.\nA person can give the virus to others during the window period.\n\n\nHIV treatment\nIs there a cure for HIV?\nThere is no cure for HIV. There are medicines that people with HIV can take to help them live well and stop the virus from building up in their body.\n\nSome people take 1 pill each day. Other people take 3 or more drugs every day.\nOver time, you can get very sick if you do not take your HIV medicines.\nPeople with HIV should not stop taking their medicines without first talking to a doctor.\nClinical trials can help researchers find a cure and improve HIV treatments. Visit the Women in Clinical Trials webpage to learn more about how you can participate.\nSome people who are at high risk of getting HIV can take medicine to lower their chance of getting the virus. PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis) is the name used when people take HIV medicines to lower their chance of getting infected.\n\nIt can be hard to manage your health and your HIV treatment. If you feel sad or stressed often, talk to your HIV counselor or healthcare provider about depression.\nWhat should you know if you are pregnant or want to get pregnant?\nA woman can pass HIV to her baby during pregnancy, labor or delivery. A woman can also pass HIV to her baby during breastfeeding.\n\nWomen with HIV should talk to their doctor before they get pregnant.\nWomen with HIV can take medicine to lower the chance of giving her baby HIV.\nSome HIV medicines should not be taken during pregnancy because they can cause birth defects. Ask your health care provider if you will need to change your medicines.\nThere are pregnancy registry studies that track women with HIV who take HIV medicines during pregnancy.\n\n\nHIV prevention\nThe most common way to get HIV is by not using a condom when you have sex with a person who has HIV. You can take steps to help protect yourself from getting HIV through sex.\nCondoms\nMale condom\nLatex condoms, the most common type, may help prevent pregnancy and reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). “Natural” or “lambskin” condoms help prevent pregnancy, but may not provide protection against STIs, including HIV. The male latex condom must be used consistently and correctly to help reduce HIV risk. The male condom cannot provide complete protection against HIV or other STIs.\nFemale condom\nWhen used in the vagina, the female condom reduces the risk of HIV and other STIs. The female condom cannot provide complete protection against HIV or other STIs.\n\n\nLearn more about using condoms as a barrier method for preventing HIV infection\n\n\nMedicine to reduce HIV risk \nWhat is PrEP?\nPrEP is short for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis.

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload English PDF (2.35 MB) En Español\nHPV (human papillomavirus) is a sexually transmitted virus. It is passed on through genital contact (such as vaginal and anal sex). It is also passed on by skin-to-skin contact. HPV is not a new virus. But many people don't know about it. Most people don't have any signs. HPV may go away on its own without causing any health problems.\nOn this page:\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWho can get HPV?\nIf there are no signs, why do I need to worry about HPV?\nIs there a test for HPV?\nCan I prevent HPV?\nWhat else can I do to lower my chances of getting HPV?\nIs there a cure for HPV?\nWhat should I know about genital warts?\n\n\nHPV and cancer\n\nWhat should I know about cervical cancer?\nWhat should I know about vaginal or vulvar cancer?\nWhat should I know about anal cancer?\n\n\nDownload the HPV fact sheet in other languages\n\nFrequently asked questions\nWho can get HPV?\nAnyone who has ever had genital contact with another person may have HPV. Both men and women may get it—and pass it on—without knowing it. Since there might not be any signs, a person may have HPV even if years have passed since he or she had sex.\nYou are more likely to get HPV if you have:\n\nsex at an early age,\nmany sex partners, or\na sex partner who has had many partners.\n\nIf there are no signs, why do I need to worry about HPV?\nThere are over 100 different kinds of HPV and not all of them cause health problems. Some kinds of HPV may cause problems like genital warts. Some kinds of HPV can also cause cancer of the cervix, vagina, vulva, or anus. Most of these problems are caused by types 6, 11, 16 or 18.\nIs there a test for HPV?\nYes. It tests for the kinds of HPV that may lead to cervical cancer. The FDA approved the HPV test to be used for women over 30 years old. It may find HPV even before there are changes to the cervix. Women who have the HPV test still need to get the Pap test.\nCan I prevent HPV?\nFDA has approved vaccines that prevent certain diseases, including cervical cancer, caused by some types of HPV. Ask your health care provider if you should get the HPV Vaccine.\nWhat else can I do to lower my chances of getting HPV?\n\nYou can choose not to have sex (abstinence).\nIf you have sex, you can limit the number of partners you have.\nChoose a partner who has had no or few sex partners. The fewer partners your partner has had—the less likely he or she is to have HPV.\nIt is not known how much condoms protect against HPV. Areas not covered by a condom can be exposed to the virus.\n\nIs there a cure for HPV?\nThere is no cure for the virus (HPV) itself. There are treatments for the health problems that HPV can cause, such as genital warts, cervical changes, and cervical cancer.\nWhat should I know about genital warts?\nThere are many treatment choices for genital warts. But even after the warts are treated, the virus might still be there and may be passed on to others. If genital warts are not treated, they may go away, stay the same, or increase in size or number, but they will not turn into cancer.\nHPV and cancer\nWhat should I know about cervical cancer?\nAll women should get regular Pap tests. The Pap test looks for cell changes caused by HPV. The test finds cell changes early—so the cervix can be treated before the cells turn into cancer. This test can also find cancer in its early stages so it can be treated before it becomes too serious. It is rare to die from cervical cancer if the disease is caught early.\nWhat should I know about vaginal or vulvar cancer?\nVaginal cancer is cancer of the vagina (birth canal). Vulvar cancer is cancer of the clitoris, vaginal lips, and opening to the vagina. Both of these kinds of cancer are very rare. Not all vaginal or vulvar cancer is caused by HPV.\nWhat should I know about anal cancer?\nAnal cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the anus. The anus is the opening of the rectum (last part of the large intestine) to the outside of the body.\nDownload HPV fact sheet in other languages\n\nArabic ( فيروس الورم الحليمي البشري ) (PDF, 229 KB)\nBengali (হিউম্যান প্যাপিলোমা ভাইরাস) (PDF, 393 KB)\nChamorro (human papillomavirus) (PDF, 360 KB)\nChinese (人乳头状瘤病毒) (PDF, 4.32 MB)\nEnglish (HPV (human papillomavirus)) (PDF, 2.35 MB)\nFrench (VPH - virus du papillome humain) (PDF, 2.28 MB)\nHaitian Creole (papillomavirus imen) (PDF, 2.28 MB)\nJapanese (ヒトパピローマ　ウイルス) (PDF, 2.39 MB)\nKorean (인간 유두종 바이러스 ) (PDF, 2.48 MB)\nPolish (wirus brodawczaka ludzkiego) (PDF, 2.27 MB)\nPortuguese (papilomavírus humano) (PDF, 2.30 MB)\nRussian (ВПЧ вирус папилломы человека) (PDF, 2.32 MB)\nSpanish (Virus del papiloma humano (VPH)) (PDF, 2.07 MB)\nTagalog (human papillomavirus) (PDF, 2.29 MB)\nUrdu (انسانی پیپیلوما وائرس) (PDF, 361 KB)\nVietnamese (virus gây u nhú ở người) (PDF, 2.28 MB)\n\nOrder HPV fact sheet in English and Spanish in bulk.\nRelated links\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HHS Office on Women’s Health)\nHPV Infection (CDC)\nHuman Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccination: What Everyone Should Know (CDC)\nHPV and Cancer (NCI)"

You are not alone. There are about 6 million pregnancies in the U.S. each year, and 80% of those who are pregnant say that they take at least one medicine. Some may be getting treatment for a health problem they had before pregnancy, while others take medicines for health problems, like diabetes, morning sickness, or high blood pressure, that can start or get worse during pregnancy. Still others take medicines or get a vaccine before they find out they are pregnant.\nPregnancy can be an exciting time. It can also make you feel uneasy if you are not sure whether the medicines you are taking may affect your developing fetus. Many medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. For other medicines, there may be less information about whether they are safe to use during pregnancy.\nHere are some tips to help you learn more about how prescription and over-the-counter medicines might affect you and your baby.\nAsk questions\nAlways talk with your health care provider before you take any medicines, dietary supplements, or vitamins. \nConsider asking these questions when talking with your health care provider:\n\nWill I need to change my medicines if I want to get pregnant or if I find out I am pregnant? Before you get pregnant, make a plan with your health care provider to help you safely use your medicines.\nHow might this medicine affect my pregnancy? Ask your health care provider about the benefits and risks of taking this medicine. \nAre there medicines and supplements I should avoid? Some medicines may harm your developing fetus during different stages of pregnancy. Your health care provider may have you take something else while you are pregnant.\nWill I need to take more or less of my medicine? Your heart and kidneys work harder when you are pregnant. This may make some medicines pass through your body faster than usual.\nCan I keep taking this medicine when I start breastfeeding? Some medicines can get into your breast milk and may affect your baby.\nWhat medicines should I take when I am pregnant? Ask your health care provider what medicines to take while pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n\nPrenatal vitamins\nTalk with your health care provider about taking prenatal vitamins. Some prenatal vitamins may have too much or too little of what you might need during pregnancy. \nWhat is folic acid? Folic acid helps to prevent birth defects of the baby’s brain or spine. Ask your health care provider about how much folic acid you should take before you become pregnant and through the first part of your pregnancy.  \n\nRead the label\nCheck the medicine label and other information you get with your medicine to learn about the possible risks during pregnancy. The label tells you what is known about how the medicine might affect you and your developing fetus.\nFind information on a certain medicine\nPrescription medicine information\nPrescription medicine labels contain helpful information about a medicine's risks during pregnancy. The labels may also have information on whether the medicine gets into breast milk and how it could possibly affect the baby.\nBe smart online\nAsk your health care provider about the information you read online. Some websites say certain medicines are or are not safe to take during pregnancy. You should always check with your health care provider first. Do not trust that a product is safe just because it says \"natural.\"\n\n\nCheck with your health care provider before you use a product that you heard about in a chat room or on social media.\n\n\nResources\n\nFDA Pharmacists Help You Use Medicines Safely\nMedicine and Pregnancy (from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n\nMarijuana, CBD, and THC \nFDA wants to ensure that individuals are aware of the serious risks of using cannabis products, including the use of cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and marijuana in any form during pregnancy or while breastfeeding/lactating due to possible risks to you and the newborn.\nUsing any form of cannabis products while pregnant can affect fetal brain development, increase the risk of a newborn with low birth weight, premature birth, and potentially still birth. Breastmilk can contain THC for up to six days after use. Consuming breastmilk containing THC may affect a newborn’s brain development and result in hyperactivity, poor cognitive function, and other long-term consequences. Research has shown that there are also risks to you such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and placental abruption.\nCannabis products claiming to be, or promoted as, treatments for relief of pain, anxiety, or morning sickness are not FDA-approved and are being sold with unproven claims. \n\nReport problems\nFirst, tell your health care provider about any problems you have with your medicine. Also, tell FDA about any serious problems you have after taking a medicine. \nWhat products are regulated by FDA\nYou should report problems like serious side effects and product quality problems. You should also report product use errors, such as accidentally taking the wrong dose or wrong medicine, that are related to unclear use or dosing instructions. Report problems or use errors with these products:\n\nHuman medicines, including vaccines\nMedical devices\nBlood products and other biologics \nMedical foods prescribed by a health care provider and intended to help manage a disease or health condition (this does not include meal replacements or diet shakes)\n\nTypes of issues you should report to FDA MedWatch\n\nUnexpected side effects or adverse events\nProduct quality problems\nProduct use/medication errors that can be prevented\nTherapeutic failures\n\nHow to report\n\nCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to get a reporting form sent to you by mail.\nReport problems to FDA online. Learn more about reporting problems to FDA.\nFor vaccines, report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) online.\n\n\nVolunteer to sign up for a pregnancy exposure registry\nPregnancy exposure registries are research studies that collect information about the effect that prescription medicines taken or vaccines received during pregnancy may have on you and your developing fetus. These studies collect information from those who are pregnant and who are taking or have taken a certain medicine or received a certain vaccine while pregnant. Some pregnancy exposure registries collect information from those who are pregnant but have not taken a certain medicine or received a certain vaccine. Some pregnancy exposure registry studies also collect information about newborn babies for a period of time after birth. \nYou can volunteer to join a pregnancy exposure registry (if one is open and enrolling). The information collected can help health care providers and others who are pregnant to learn more about the safety of medicines and vaccines used during pregnancy.  \n\nHelp others who are pregnant by sharing your experiences with medicines and vaccines.\nYou will be asked to provide information about your health and possibly your baby's health.\n\n\n\nFDA has a list of ongoing pregnancy exposure registries on its website but does not run the pregnancy exposure registry studies. The drug companies that make the medicines and vaccines are usually in charge of the pregnancy exposure registry for their product. Sometimes, these research studies are run by other researchers. See if there is a pregnancy registry research study for your medicine or vaccine.\n\n\nTo learn more about pregnancy exposure registries visit www.fda.gov/pregnancyregistries\nRelated links\n\nGet information about a specific drug\nPregnant?

Be aware that natural doesn’t always mean safe. Also, remember that each woman is different. A product that worked for your friend may not be right for you.\n\n\nMenopause & Hormones: Common Questions (PDF, 2 MB) en Español\nOn this page:\n\nWhat is menopause?\nSymptoms\nHormone therapy\nNon-hormone treatments\nHerbs and other \"natural\" products\nLiving with menopause\nDownload menopause fact sheet in other languages\n\nWhat is menopause?\nMenopause is a normal, natural change in a woman’s life when her period stops. That’s why some people call menopause “the change of life” or “the change.” Your period may start to change as your body moves into menopause. You may have irregular or heavier periods. Speak with your health care provider about any changes in your periods or bleeding.\nDuring menopause, a woman’s body slowly produces less of the hormones, estrogen and progesterone. This often happens between ages 45 and 55. A woman has reached menopause when she has not had a period for 12 months in a row.\n\n\nSpeak with your health care provider about when it is safe for you to stop using birth control. Do not stop taking your birth control even if you have a positive result from a menopause home test kit. It may still be possible for you to get pregnant.\n\n\nWhat are the symptoms of menopause?\nEvery woman’s period will stop at menopause. Some women may not have any other symptoms at all. As you near menopause, you may have:\n\n\nChanges in your period—time between periods or flow may be different.\n\n\nHot flashes (“hot flushes”)—getting warm in the face, neck, or chest, with and without sweating.\n\n\nNight sweats that may lead to problems sleeping and feeling tired, stressed, or tense.\n\n\nVaginal changes—the vagina may become dry and thin, and sex may be painful.\n\n\nThinning of your bones, which may lead to loss of height and bone breaks (osteoporosis).\n\n\nSpeak with your health care provider to discuss whether treatment is right for you if your menopause symptoms are interfering with your usual activities or get worse. \nTreatments for menopausal symptoms include hormone therapy and non-hormonal therapy. In addition, hormone therapy can be used to prevent bone loss in some situations.\nHormone therapy\nWhat is hormone therapy for menopause?\nLower hormone levels in menopause may lead to hot flashes, vaginal dryness. To help with these problems, some women choose to treat their symptoms with hormone medicines, sometimes called menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Women may be prescribed estrogen or estrogen with progestin (another hormone).\nMenopause hormone therapy is not for everyone. Like all medicines, hormone therapy has benefits and risks. Talk with your health care provider about hormone therapy. If you decide to use hormone therapy, use it at the lowest dose that helps. Also use hormones for the shortest time that you need them.\nWho should not take hormone therapy for menopause?\nWomen who:\n\nThink they are pregnant.\nHave problems with vaginal bleeding.\nHave certain kinds of cancers.\nHave had a stroke or heart attack.\nHave had blood clots.\nHave liver disease.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using hormone therapy for menopause?\n\nHormone therapy may help relieve hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, or dyspareunia (pain with sexual activity).\nHormones may reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis—thin, weak bones that break easily.\n\nWhat are the risks of using hormone therapy?\nFor some women, hormone therapy may increase their chances of getting blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and gall bladder disease. For a woman with a uterus, estrogen increases the chance of getting endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterine lining). Adding progestin lowers this risk.\nHow long should I use hormone therapy for menopause symptoms?\nTreatment of menopausal symptoms should be decided with your health care provider, as there are many different FDA-approved hormones for treatment of the symptoms of menopause.\nDoes it make a difference what form of hormones I use for menopause?\nYes. FDA recommends that women use hormone therapies that are FDA-approved. FDA-approved hormone therapies are evaluated for safety and effectiveness.\nAre compounded “bioidentical hormones” safer or more effective than FDA-approved hormone therapy for menopause?\nMany marketed products that are called “bioidentical hormones” are compounded drugs, which are not FDA-approved. FDA does not have evidence that compounded “bioidentical hormones” are safe and effective, or safer or more effective than FDA-approved hormone therapy.\nFDA has approved drugs containing hormones that are identical to the hormones made naturally by women in their reproductive years.\nIs the hormone estriol a “safer form of estrogen”?\nFDA does not have evidence that drugs containing estriol are safe and effective, or are “safer forms of estrogen.” There are no FDA-approved drugs containing estriol. Marketed drugs that contain estriol are compounded drugs, which are not FDA-approved.\nNon-hormone treatments\nSome women use non-hormonal medicines for their menopause symptoms. FDA has approved:\n\nA medicine (PDF, 654 KB) used to reduce moderate to severe hot flashes associated with menopause. \nA medicine used to reduce moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. Vasomotor symptoms are the feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden intense feelings of heat and sweating (“hot flashes” or “hot flushes”).\nA medicine (PDF, 386 KB) used to treat and prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis, and reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in post-menopausal women, including postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer.\nA medicine (PDF, 568 KB) used after menopause for women with or without a uterus to treat moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse due to changes in and around the vagina.\n\nAre herbs and other \"natural\" products useful in treatment symptoms of menopause?\nSome women may decide to use products marketed as dietary supplements or over-the-counter “natural” hormone creams to help them deal with their menopausal symptoms.  At this time, FDA does not know if herbs or other “natural” products are helpful or safe. These products may also have health risks. Don’t get scammed by products making false claims about miracle cures for weight gain, hair loss, wrinkles, or other changes that can happen during or after menopause. Get the facts.\n\nCheck with your health care provider for information about using these products.\nLearn more about dietary supplements.\n\n\nShould I use estrogen just to prevent thin bones?\nEstrogen with or without progestogen (also known as progestin) is approved for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Bones affected by osteoporosis may become so weak that fractures (broken bones) may occur spontaneously or as a result of a minor fall or normal stresses, such as bending, lifting, or coughing. \nWhat causes osteoporosis?\nIn women, osteoporosis is often caused by bone loss that occurs with the hormonal changes (low levels of estrogen) that come with menopause. Estrogen plays an important role in building and maintaining your bones. After menopause, your body makes very little estrogen.\nThe risk of developing osteoporosis is higher if you did not develop strong bones when you were young. Lack of physical activity, eating disorders, or other health problems can prevent you from building bone mass early in life, leading to less bone mass later. \nWho gets osteoporosis?\nOsteoporosis is a common cause of fractures in postmenopausal women and in older men. It affects more women than men. Of the estimated 10 million Americans with osteoporosis, more than 8 million (80%) are women. In the United States, osteoporosis affects one in four women aged 65 or older, but younger women can also get osteoporosis. \nOsteoporosis affects people of all races and ethnic groups but is most common in non-Hispanic white women and Asian women. Girls and women of all ages need to take steps to protect their bones. \nWho is at risk?\nYou may be more likely to get osteoporosis if you:\n\nAre female\nAre over age 50\nSmoke\nHave a slim, thin body\nHave family members who had osteoporosis \nDo not get enough weight-bearing exercise, such as walking\nDrink alcohol (more than 3 drinks a day)\nHave certain other medical conditions or take certain medicines for a long time\n\nHow do I know if I have osteoporosis?\nOsteoporosis is a “silent” disease because you typically do not have symptoms. You may not even know you have the disease until you break a bone. A fracture can happen in any bone of the body, but fractures from osteoporosis are most common in the hip, wrist, and spine.  \nThere are tests that use either X-rays or ultrasound (sound waves) to measure bone density and can help determine if you have osteoporosis. X-ray tests, called DXA scans, examine your spine, hip, and/or wrist. DXA scans use a very small amount of radiation. Ultrasound tests the condition of the bone but is not used alone for diagnosis of osteoporosis. If the ultrasound indicates that you may have bone loss, you will still need a DXA scan test to diagnose bone loss and osteoporosis.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends osteoporosis screening for women over the age of 65 and for women of any age who have factors that increase the chance of developing osteoporosis. Ask your health care provider if you need a bone density test before age 65.\nHow is osteoporosis treated?\nThere is no way to cure osteoporosis. There are things you can do, listed below, to prevent more bone loss or build new bone mass and strengthen bones. Talk with your health care provider and make a plan to keep your bones healthy.\nLifestyle changes\nThere are lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk for osteoporosis.\n\nStay physically active. Do weight bearing exercise like walking.\nDo not smoke.\nLimit alcohol use.\nGet enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Your health care provider may suggest taking calcium and vitamin D pills.\n\nDietary supplements\nDietary supplements are products that people add to their diets. Getting enough vitamins, like vitamin D, and minerals, such as calcium, is important for bone health. Talk with your health care provider before you take any dietary supplements. These may affect your other medicines.\nPrescription medicines\nThere are prescription medicines that you can take. These medicines may come as a pill, a nasal spray, or a shot (injection). \nThe following types of medicines can help treat osteoporosis. Most, but not all, of these medicines have been shown to reduce the risk of bone fracture. Talk with your health care provider about which medicine is right for you:\n\nBisphosphonates\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs\nRANKL inhibitor\nSclerostin inhibitors\nCalcitonin analogs\nSelective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)\n\nAll medicines have potential side effects. Talk with your health care provider about which of these medicines may be right for you. \nIf you are already on a medicine for osteoporosis, talk with your health care provider before you stop taking your medicine.\nHow do I prevent osteoporosis?\nTo help prevent osteoporosis, focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Building strong bones during childhood and the teen years is important to help prevent osteoporosis later in life. Regular check-ups and bone density tests can also be beneficial for early detection and management. \nTalk with your health care provider for advice on osteoporosis prevention based on your age, health, and risk factors.\nHow do I participate in research for osteoporosis?\nClinical trials can help health care providers learn more about treatments for osteoporosis. Visit the Women in Clinical Trials webpage to learn more about how you can participate.\n\nDOWNLOAD - NWHW 2024 Social Media Partner Toolkit which focuses on bone health and osteoporosis.

However, these medicines can also cause serious injury or death when misused or abused. They can also be addictive. It is important to talk to your healthcare provider about how to safely use pain medicines. Also, ask your healthcare provider about other options to treat pain.\nWomen experience pain differently than men\n\nWomen report more pain than men.\nSome types of long-term (chronic) pain, like migraines and back pain, are more common in women.\nWomen may become dependent on prescription pain medicines more quickly than men.\nWomen are more likely to be prescribed prescription pain medicines, be given higher doses, and use them for longer time periods than men.\n\nTypes of Pain Medicines\nOver-the-Counter (OTC) Medicines\nOTC pain medicines are in many common products for headaches, colds, and menstrual (period) cramps. Common types of OTC pain medicines are acetaminophen and NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), such as aspirin and low-dose ibuprofen.\nPrescription Medicines\n\nNon-opioid medicines – Medicines that treat pain. Types of non-opioid prescription medicines include diclofenac and ibuprofen. While ibuprofen is also available over-the-counter, your healthcare provider may give you higher doses.\nOpioids – Medicines that may be effective for reducing moderate to severe pain, like after a surgery. Common opioids include oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and morphine. \n\nTake steps to protect yourself and your loved ones.\n\nAsk your healthcare provider if you should take opioids or use other options to effectively manage your pain. Opioids are not right for everyone or every type of pain.\nKeep track of your pain. Make note when you feel pain, what it feels like, and where your body hurts. Share these notes with your healthcare provider.\nDon’t share prescription pain medicines. Keep pain medicines locked up and away from children and others.\nDon’t take pain medicines for longer than you are supposed to. Get the facts about your medicine. Find out how long you should take it. If you are taking other medications, ask your healthcare provider if pain medications are safe to take at the same time.\nDon’t drink alcohol or use medicines like antihistamines and benzodiazepines when you take certain pain medicines. Combining alcohol and different types of pain medicines or other drugs can cause you to stop breathing.\nTell your healthcare provider if you have been addicted to medications, other drugs, or alcohol.\nGet rid of unused prescription pain medicines. Check the FDA website or ask your healthcare provider about the best way to get rid of unused medication.\nCall 1-800-662-HELP (4357) or visit https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/ if you or a loved one needs help finding treatment for addiction to pain medicines."

They grow in and around the muscular wall of the uterus (womb). They can grow as a single tumor or there can be many. They can be as small as an apple seed or as big as a grapefruit. Fibroids can grow or stay about the same size over time. Another medical term for fibroids is leiomyoma or just “myoma”.\n\n\tThe Power of Your Story: Meet La-Anna\n\nHow can uterine fibroids impact you? Meet La-Anna, who has navigated life with fibroids for many years.\n\n\nWhat are the symptoms of fibroids?\nFibroids do not always cause symptoms. People who have symptoms may find fibroids hard to live with. Symptoms of fibroids can include changes in menstruation (your period), heavy bleeding, vaginal bleeding between periods, painful periods, anemia (low red blood cell count, resulting from excessive bleeding), fullness or pressure in the lower abdominal area, frequent urination, pain the belly or lower back, and pain during sex. Fibroids can cause other reproductive problems, such as infertility, miscarriages, and obstetrical problems such as early labor and/or increased likelihood of Cesarean section.\nWhat causes fibroids?\nNo one knows for sure what causes fibroids. Researchers think more than one factor could play a role. These factors include age, having a family member with fibroids, race/ethnic origin, being overweight or obese, having high blood pressure, and/or certain dietary factors and/or hormones.\nHow do I know if I have fibroids?\nUnless you have symptoms, you might not know if you have fibroids. In some cases, a healthcare provider will find fibroids during a routine pelvic exam. Your provider may also order medical imaging like a pelvic ultrasound to see a picture of the fibroids. Imaging tests might include: \n\nUltrasound – uses sound waves to make a picture; the ultrasound probe may be placed on the abdomen (belly) or inside the vagina\nSaline infusion sonohysterography (SIS or SHG) or saline ultrasound – uses a small amount of saline (salt solution) placed in the uterus (womb) to help “see” inside of the uterus on an ultrasound \nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – uses magnets and radio waves to make a picture of the inside of your body\nComputed tomography (CT) or computer-assisted tomography (CAT) scan – scans the body with X-rays from many angles to form a more complete picture than a plain x-ray \n\nOther tests your healthcare provider may order include:\n\nComplete blood count (CBC) – blood test to check for signs of anemia (low red blood cell count)\nBlood levels of iron - blood test to measure the iron levels and confirm if iron-deficiency anemia exists\n\nSurgery (i.e. hysteroscopy) can confirm the ultrasound diagnosis of fibroids and provide additional information like the location of the fibroids.\nHow are fibroids treated?\nIf you have fibroids but do not have symptoms, you may not need medical intervention. If you have symptoms, there are medical treatments that may help. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to treat your fibroids. Your provider can check during regular exams and with imaging to see if your fibroids have grown. \nContact your healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\nHeavy bleeding or bleeding between periods\nSignificant cramping or pain with periods\nA full or heavy feeling in or near your belly\nFrequent urination or difficulty with urination\n\nIf you have moderate or severe symptoms from your fibroids, your provider may recommend medical treatment, surgery or other interventional procedures depending on your symptoms and history. Medical treatments include hormonal medical treatments such as birth control pills, vaginal contraceptive rings, or intrauterine devices with hormone(s), which can help control heavy menstrual bleeding associated with fibroids. Newer medicines have been approved to manage heavy menstrual bleeding associated with fibroids in premenopausal women. Surgical options include removal of the fibroid(s) (myomectomy), destruction of the fibroid(s) without removal, or removal of the uterus (hysterectomy). These procedures can be performed using different methods, ranging from minimally invasive procedures to vaginal or open abdominal surgery. The type of surgery/procedure will depend on how many fibroids are present, where the fibroids are located and whether children are desired in the future. \nTalk with your provider about all your medical treatment options and their risks and benefits. Your provider can answer all your questions and together you can decide which treatment is right for you.\nDiverse Women in Clinical Trials campaign\nClinical trials can help doctors learn more about safe treatments for fibroids. The FDA Office of Women's Health is partnering with the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health to raise awareness about diverse women of different ages, races, ethnic backgrounds, and health conditions participating in clinical trials.\nVisit the Women in Clinical Trials webpage to learn more about participating in a clinical trial and find a study here.\nFor resources and materials on other women's health topics, visit www.fda.gov/womens.\nDownload Uterine Fibroids fact sheet in other languages\n\nArabic (الأورام الليفية الرحمية) (PDF, 504 KB)\nChinese (子宫肌瘤) (PDF, 652 KB)\nEnglish (Uterine Fibroids) (PDF, 482 KB)\nFrench (fibromes utérins) (PDF, 470 KB)\nHaitian Creole (Fibwòm Nan Matris) (PDF, 206 KB)\nJapanese (子宮筋腫) (PDF, 572 KB)\nKorean (자궁근종) (PDF, 575 KB)\nPolish (Mięśniaki Macicy) (PDF, 557 KB)\nPortuguese (Miomas uterinos) (PDF, 474 KB)\nRussian (Фибромиома матки) (PDF, 500 KB)\nSpanish (Los Fibromas Uterinos) (PDF, 230 KB)\nTagalog (Mga Fibroid sa Matris) (PDF, 465 KB)\nVietnamese (U xơ tử cung) (PDF, 489 KB)\n\nOrder Uterine Fibroids fact sheet in English and Spanish in bulk\nRelated links\n\nDownload Uterine Fibroids Tip Card: Tips for Young Women (English PDF, 689 KB)\nDownload Uterine Fibroids Tip Card: Tips for Young Women (Spanish PDF, 709 KB)\nKnowledge & News on Women: Fibroid Awareness Month (OWH Blog, July 2022)\nFDA Approves New Option to Treat Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Fibroids in Women (May 29, 2020)\nFDA Takes New Steps to Increase the Safety of Laparoscopic Power Morcellators when used in Gynecologic Surgeries (February 25, 2020)\nLearn More About Laparoscopic Power Morcellators  \nWhite Dress Project\nUterine Fibroids (HHS Office of Women's Health)\nUterine Fibroids (NIH NICHD)\nUterine Fibroids (Medline Plus)"

        "content": "Download the Booklet in English\nDownload the Booklet in Spanish (En Español)\nFood safety is important for everyone – but it’s extremely important for individuals with a weakened immune system, which makes them especially vulnerable to foodborne illness. This guide is intended to help older adults and people with cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, or autoimmune diseases avoid foodborne infections.\nIn addition to the information in this booklet, talk with your health care provider about any foods or other products to avoid because of any special health needs you may have.\nThe Immune System: Its Importance\nYour immune system is vital for your health because it defends your body against infectious organisms and other invaders. Spread throughout your body, the immune system is made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect you. When your immune system senses disease-causing organisms and other substances that invade the body, it responds to fight them off.\nAs people get older, their immune systems decline. Diseases such as cancer and diabetes can weaken the immune system. Also, medications for HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, and autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, weaken the immune system.\nFood Safety: Why It’s Critical for People with a Weakened Immune System\nWhen disease-causing bacteria, viruses, or parasites (germs) contaminate food, they can cause foodborne illness, often called food poisoning. While the food supply in the United States is among the safest in the world, it can still be a source of infection.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 48 million persons — or 1 of every 6 people get foodborne infections each year. Of those, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from their foodborne illness. People who have a weakened immune system have a higher risk for food poisoning. People with weakened immune systems are more likely to have a lengthier illness, undergo hospitalization, or even die as a result of foodborne disease.\n\nOlder Adults — People 65 and older are at a higher risk for hospitalization and death from foodborne illness. This increased risk is because organs and body systems change as the body ages.\n\n\t\nThe digestive system holds food longer, allowing bacteria to grow while the stomach may not produce enough acid to limit the number of intestinal bacteria.\nThe liver and kidneys may not properly rid the body of foreign bacteria and toxins.\nBetween 50 and 60, the immune system in most people begins to decline. After age 75, many adults have an immune system so weakened that their risk for contracting a foodborne illness increases while the ability of their bodies to fight the infection is lowered.\n\n\nPeople with Cancer — If it spreads into the bone marrow, cancer can weaken the immune system. Also, most cancer patients undergo therapy such as radiation, chemotherapy, and/or medications to help fight the disease. A side effect of these treatments is that they may weaken the immune system, making patients more vulnerable to infections like foodborne illnesses.\nPeople with Diabetes — The immune systems of the millions of people with diabetes in the United States may not readily recognize the bacteria and viruses that cause food poisoning. This delayed response places a person with diabetes at increased risk for infection. Also, diabetes may damage the cells that create stomach acid and the nerves that help the stomach and intestines move food through the normal digestive process. As result, the digestive tract may hold on to food for a longer time, allowing harmful bacteria and viruses to multiply. In addition, diabetes may cause the kidneys, which work to cleanse the body, to hold on to harmful bacteria, toxins, and other pathogens.\nPeople with HIV/AIDS — When the Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) damages or destroys the immune system, individuals become more vulnerable to developing an infection, including a foodborne infection.\nPeople with Organ Transplants — A healthy immune system will try to reject or destroy an organ or bone marrow transplant – in the same way that the immune system works to clear infection from the body. Therefore, transplant recipients commonly take medications to keep rejection from happening. These drugs are called immunosuppressants because they suppress a person’s immune system to keep it from attacking, or rejecting transplanted organs or bone marrow. A side effect of immunosuppressants is that they leave patients more susceptible to developing infections – like those that can be brought on by the bacteria and viruses that cause foodborne illness.\nPeople with Autoimmune Diseases — Autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus are conditions in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body. People with autoimmune diseases are often treated with immunosuppressants, and they are more likely to get a foodborne illness because their immune systems can’t fight infection effectively.\n\nDownload the Booklet in English\nDownload the Booklet in Spanish (En Español)"

        "topic": "Sodium in Your Diet",
        "content": "Print & Share (PDF 1.56MB)\nSpanish (Español)\n\n \n\n\nYou’ve probably heard that most Americans eat too much sodium. Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium can be bad for your health. Diets higher in sodium are associated with an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, which is a major cause of stroke and heart disease.\nDespite what many people think, most dietary sodium (over 70%) comes from eating packaged and prepared foods—not from table salt added to food when cooking or eating. The food supply contains too much sodium and Americans who want to consume less sodium can have a difficult time doing so. That is why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is working with the food industry to make reasonable reductions in sodium across a wide variety of foods. Even though sodium may already be in many packaged foods when you purchase them, you can lower your daily sodium intake by using the Nutrition Facts label.\nLook at the Label!\nUse the Nutrition Facts label as your tool to make informed decisions!\n\nKnow the Daily Value. The Daily Values are reference amounts of nutrients to consume or not to exceed each day. The Daily Value for sodium is less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day.\n\n\nUse % Daily Value (%DV) as a tool. The %DV is the percentage of the Daily Value for each nutrient in a serving of the food and shows how much of a nutrient contributes to a total daily diet. \nUse %DV to determine if a serving of the food is high or low in sodium and to compare and choose foods to get less than 100% DV of sodium each day.\nAs a general guide: 5% DV or less of sodium per serving is considered low, and 20% DV or more of sodium per serving is considered high.\n\nPay attention to servings. The nutrition information listed on the Nutrition Facts label is usually based on one serving of the food. Check the serving size and the number of servings you eat or drink to determine how much sodium you are consuming.\n\nFood Choices Matter!\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 40% of the sodium consumed by Americans comes from the following foods:\n\nDeli meat sandwiches\nPizza\nBurritos and tacos\nSoups\nSavory Snacks (e.g. chips, crackers, popcorn)\nPoultry\nPasta mixed dishes\nBurgers\nEgg dishes and omelets\n\nBut remember, the sodium content can vary significantly between similar types of foods. So, use the Nutrition Facts label to compare products, and don’t forget to check the serving size in order to make an accurate comparison.\n\nTable Salt and Sodium: Defined\nThe words “table salt” and “sodium” are often used interchangeably, but they do not mean the same thing. Table salt (also known by its chemical name, sodium chloride) is a crystal-like compound that is abundant in nature. Sodium is a mineral, and one of the chemical elements found in salt.\n\nSodium as a Food Ingredient\nAs a food ingredient, sodium has multiple uses, such as for curing meat, baking, thickening, retaining moisture, enhancing flavor (including the flavor of other ingredients), and as a preservative. Some common food additives—like monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), sodium nitrite, and sodium benzoate—also contain sodium and contribute (in lesser amounts) to the total amount of “sodium” listed on the Nutrition Facts label.\nSurprisingly, some foods that don’t taste salty can still be high in sodium, which is why using taste alone is not an accurate way to judge a food’s sodium content. For example, while some foods that are high in sodium (like pickles and soy sauce) taste salty, there are also many foods (like cereals and pastries) that contain sodium but don’t taste salty. Also, some foods that you may eat several times a day (such as breads) can add up to a lot of sodium over the course of a day, even though an individual serving may not be high in sodium.\n\nCheck the Package for Nutrient Claims\nYou can also check for nutrient claims on food and beverage packages to quickly identify those that may contain less sodium. Here’s a guide to common claims and what they mean:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat It Says \n\n\nWhat It Means \n\n\n\nSalt/Sodium-Free\nLess than 5 mg of sodium per serving\n\n\nVery Low Sodium\n35 mg of sodium or less per serving\n\n\nLow Sodium\n140 mg of sodium or less per serving\n\n\nReduced Sodium\nAt least 25% less sodium than the regular product\n\n\nLight in Sodium or Lightly Salted\nAt least 50% less sodium than the regular product\n\n\nNo-Salt-Added or Unsalted\nNo salt is added during processing – but these products may not be salt/sodium-free unless stated\n\n\n\n\n\nSodium and Blood Pressure\nSodium attracts water, and a high-sodium diet draws water into the bloodstream, which can increase the volume of blood and subsequently your blood pressure. High blood pressure (also known as hypertension) is a condition in which blood pressure remains elevated over time. Hypertension makes the heart work too hard, and the high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs (such as the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes). Uncontrolled high blood pressure can raise the risk of heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. In addition, blood pressure generally rises as you get older, so limiting your sodium intake becomes even more important each year.\n\nKnow Your Numbers\nSodium is an essential nutrient and is needed by the body in relatively small amounts(provided that substantial sweating does not occur) to maintain a balance of body fluids and keep muscles and nerves running smoothly. However, most Americans eat too much of it—and they may not even know it.\nAmericans eat on average about 3,400 mg of sodium per day. However, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day—that’s equal to about 1 teaspoon of table salt! For children under age 14, recommended limits are even lower.\n\n10 Easy Tips for Reducing Sodium Consumption\nLearning about sodium in foods and exploring new ways to prepare foods can help you achieve your sodium goal. And, if you follow these tips to reduce the amount of sodium you consume, your “taste” for sodium will gradually decrease over time—so eventually, you may not even miss it!\n\nRead the Nutrition Facts label \n\tCompare and choose foods to get less than 100% DV (less than 2,300 mg) of sodium each day.\nPrepare your own food when you can \n\tLimit packaged sauces, mixes, and “instant” products (including flavored rice, instant noodles, and ready-made pasta).\nAdd flavor without adding sodium \n\tLimit the amount of table salt you add to foods when cooking, baking, or at the table. Try no-salt seasoning blends and herbs and spices instead of salt to add flavor to your food.\nBuy fresh \n\tChoose fresh meat, poultry, and seafood, rather than processed varieties. Also, check the package on fresh meat and poultry to see if salt water or saline has been added.\nWatch your veggies \n\tBuy fresh, frozen (no sauce or seasoning), or low sodium or no-salt-added canned vegetables.\nGive sodium the “rinse” \n\tRinse sodium-containing canned foods, such as beans, tuna, and vegetables before eating. This removes some of the sodium.\n“Unsalt” your snacks \n\tChoose low sodium or no-salt-added nuts, seeds, and snack products (such as chips and pretzels)—or have carrot or celery sticks instead.\nConsider your condiments \n\tSodium in condiments can add up. Choose light or reduced sodium condiments, add oil and vinegar to salads rather than bottled dressings, and use only a small amount of seasoning from flavoring packets instead of the entire packet.\nReduce your portion size \n\tLess food means less sodium. Prepare smaller portions at home and consume less when eating out—choose smaller sizes, split an entrée with a friend, or take home part of your meal.\nMake lower-sodium choices at restaurants \n\tAsk for your meal to be prepared without table salt and request that sauces and salad dressings be served “on the side,” then use less of them.  You can also ask if nutrition information is available and then choose options that are lower in sodium\n\n\nMore on Sodium Reduction"

        "content": "Download in PDF (2 MB) | en español (Spanish)\nMaking healthy dietary choices can help you feel your best and stay active. It can also help you lower your risk of developing some health conditions that are common among older adults.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a tool to help you make informed food choices that can have positive effects on your health and wellness. It is called the Nutrition Facts label and you can find it on packaged foods and beverages. Read this page to learn how to use the Nutrition Facts label.\n\nUnderstanding the Nutrition Facts Label\nNutrients and Your Needs\nUse the Nutrition Facts Label to Make Healthy Choices: 3 Tips\n\n\nUnderstanding the Nutrition Facts Label\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe following key terms are intended to make it easier for you to use the Nutrition Facts labels to make informed food choices.\nServings Per Container shows the total number of servings in the entire food package or container. One package of food may contain more than one serving. For example, if you eat or drink two servings, you are getting double the calories and double the nutrients that are listed on the label.\nServing Size is based on the amount of food that is usually eaten at one time. Serving size is not a recommendation of how much to eat. The nutrition information listed on the label is usually based on one serving of the food; however, some containers may also have nutrition information listed for the entire package.\nCalories refers to the total number of calories in a serving of the food. To achieve or maintain a healthy body weight, balance the number of calories you eat and drink with the number of calories your body uses.\n2,000 calories a day is used as a general guide for nutrition advice. Your calorie needs may be higher or lower and vary depending on your age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity level. Check your calorie needs at www.myplate.gov/myplate-plan.\n% Daily Value (%DV) shows how much a nutrient in a serving of the food contributes to a total daily diet. The Daily Values are reference amounts (in grams, milligrams, or micrograms) of nutrients to consume or not to exceed each day.\nUse the %DV to determine if a serving of the food is high or low in an individual nutrient. You can also use the %DV to compare food products (make sure the serving size is the same). For example, if you eat one serving of a food and it provides 10% DV of dietary fiber, then for that day, you have eaten 10% of your dietary fiber daily goal.\n\n \n\n\nNutrients and Your Needs\n\n \n\n\nNutrients are substances in your food that keep your body working well. Eating too much or too little of some nutrients may increase your risk of certain chronic diseases, such as heart disease and high blood pressure.\nOlder adults have different nutritional needs than other age groups. The Nutrition Facts label can help you monitor some of the nutrients in your diet.\nThis booklet gives some basic facts about the nutrients commonly seen on the Nutrition Facts label. Use this page to help you talk to your healthcare provider about which nutrients you should track closely for your overall health. Visit www.myplate.gov/ for more information on making healthy food choices.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nGet More of These Nutrients: Dietary Fiber, Vitamin D, Calcium, and Potassium\n\n\nMany older adults do not get the recommended amount of these nutrients. More often, compare and choose foods to get more of these nutrients on most days.\nDietary fiber is a type of carbohydrate that cannot be easily digested. It can speed up the movement of food and waste through the body increasing the frequency of bowel movements. Diets higher in dietary fiber may reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The Daily Value for dietary fiber is 28 grams (g) per day.*\nCalcium is a mineral that is important for bone health. It also helps with muscle and nerve function, blood clotting, and hormone secretion. Diets higher in calcium can reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis (weak and brittle bones). The Daily Value for calcium is 1,300 milligrams (mg) per day.*\n\n \n\n\nVitamin D helps your body absorb calcium and is important for bone health. It also plays a role in blood pressure management, hormone production, and immune and nervous system function. Diets higher in vitamin D can reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis (weak and brittle bones). The Daily Value for vitamin D is 20 micrograms (mcg) per day.*\nPotassium is a mineral that helps with fluid balance and heart, muscle, and nervous system function. The Daily Value for potassium is 4,700 mg per day.*\n*Based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nGet Less of These Nutrients: Saturated Fat, Sodium, and Added Sugars\n\n\nMost older adults get too much of these nutrients. More often, compare and choose foods to get less of these nutrients each day.\nSaturated fat is found in higher amounts in animal products. An exception is seafood, which is generally low in saturated fat. Unsaturated fats are found in higher amounts in plant-based oils (e.g., canola and olive oils), nuts, seeds, and seafood. Diets in which unsaturated fats are eaten in place of saturated fats and within the recommended daily limits for calories, are associated with a reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The Daily Value for saturated fat is less than 20 g per day.*\nSodium is a mineral and is commonly found in table salt and in many commercially processed, packaged and prepared foods. The body needs sodium in relatively small amounts. Sodium is important for fluid balance as well as muscle and nervous system function. Diets higher in sodium are associated with an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, which can raise the risk of heart attacks, heart failure, stroke, kidney disease, and blindness. Since blood pressure often rises with age, limiting your sodium intake becomes even more important each year. The Daily Value for sodium is less than 2,300 mg per day.*\nAdded sugars includes sugars that are added during the processing of foods (such as sucrose or dextrose), foods packaged as sweeteners (such as table sugar), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices. Diets high in calories from added sugars can make it harder to meet nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits. The Daily Value for Added Sugars is less than 50 g per day.*\n*Based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet.\n\nUse the Nutrition Facts Label to Make Healthy Choices\n3 Tips\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCheck the Servings.\nThe nutrition information listed on the label is usually based on one serving of the food. When comparing calories and nutrients in different foods, check the serving size to make a correct comparison.\nAnd remember, it is common for a food package or beverage to have more than one serving.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nKnow Your Calorie Needs.\n2,000 calories a day is used as a general guide for nutrition advice. However, your calorie needs may be higher or lower and depend on your age, sex, height, weight, and the amount of physical activity you get each day. Talk to your healthcare provider about your calorie and nutrition needs, as you age.\nVisit www.myplate.gov/myplate-plan and talk to your healthcare provider to see what calorie range is right for you.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUse % Daily Value as a Guide.\nThe %DV can help you look for foods to decide which is the better choice for you.\nOlder adults should more often look for foods with a higher %DV of dietary fiber, vitamin D, calcium, and potassium. Older adults should also more often look for foods with a lower %DV of saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars. Talk to your healthcare provider about which nutrients you should track closely for your overall health.\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the Nutrition Facts label, go to: www.fda.gov/nutritioneducation\nFor more information, contact the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition’s Food and Cosmetic Information Center at 1-800-SAFEFOOD (toll free), Monday through Friday 10 AM to 4PM ET (except Thursdays from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM ET and Federal holidays)."

        "topic": "Food Serving Sizes: Get a Reality Check",
        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nThe last time you scooped some ice cream for dessert, did you limit yourself to half a cup? If you took more—you’re right in step with most people these days.\nLikewise with a soft drink: Do you drink 8 ounces, 12 ounces, or even the whole 20-ounce bottle?\nIce cream and soft drinks are just two food products that have been affected by changes in serving size requirements that are included in the updated Nutrition Facts label. The goal: to bring serving sizes closer to what people actually eat so that when they look at calories and nutrients on the label, these numbers more closely match what they are consuming.\nThe serving sizes listed on the Nutrition Facts label are not recommended serving sizes. By law, serving sizes must be based on how much food people actually consume, and not on what they should eat.\nIn 1993, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration created the Nutrition Facts label, the standards used to determine serving sizes—called the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed (RACCs)—were based primarily on surveys of food consumption conducted in 1977-1978 and 1987-1988. The 1993 RACCs were used by manufacturers for over 20 years to calculate the serving sizes on their packages.\nThe updated RACCs used to set the requirements for serving sizes on packages are now based on 2003 to 2008 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.\nIn some cases, the reference amounts used to set serving sizes are smaller. Today’s individually packaged yogurts more often come in 6-ounce containers, versus the previous 8-ounce ones. The FDA is now using a 6-ounce reference amount for yogurt.\nBut the serving size for ice cream is now a little larger. Instead of a half of a cup, it’s now two-thirds of a cup.\nChanges Based on Package Size\nThe FDA also changed the criteria for labeling based on package size. With the updated requirements, more food products previously labeled as more than one serving are now required to be labeled as just one serving. Why? Because people are more likely to eat or drink the entire container or item in one sitting. Examples include a 20-ounce can of soda, and a 15-ounce can of soup. And many large muffins that were previously labeled as two or even three servings will be labeled as a single serving under the updated requirements, consistent with how people generally consume them. \nCertain larger packages that may be consumed either in one sitting or more than one sitting—depending on your appetite and inclination—must now be labeled both per serving and per package. This dual-column format is required if a package contains at least two times the reference amount customarily consumed (on which the serving size is based) and less than or equal to three times the reference amount. Some examples are a 19-ounce can of soup and 3-ounce bag of chips.\nPreviously, manufacturers were only required to provide the calorie and nutrient information per serving, and you would have to do the math if you’re eating the whole container. So if you have a hankering for some chips and eat an entire package, now you’ll have easier access to information about what you’re consuming.\nFor packages that are clearly larger than most people would eat in one sitting—one that has more than three servings—the dual column is not required. Manufacturers are only required in these cases to label these products per serving. Examples include a “party size” bag of chips or a two-liter bottle of soda.\nThe FDA hopes the updated label will make it easier for people to determine the number of calories and nutrients they’re actually consuming so they can ultimately make healthier food choices for themselves and their families."

        "topic": "Tablet Splitting",
        "content": "At some point your healthcare or managed care company may have recommended tablet splitting for reasons such as to adjust the dosing of your medication or to reduce costs. In such cases, it is your healthcare professional's responsibility to monitor the impact of risks associated with the practice of tablet splitting. You should always talk to your healthcare professional before splitting a tablet and not be afraid to ask him or her questions if you are considering splitting tablets.\nWhen considering whether to split a tablet, you and your healthcare professional should bear in mind the following:\n\nIf a tablet is FDA-approved to be split, this information will be printed in the “HOW SUPPLIED” section of the professional label insert and in the patient package insert. Also, the tablet will be scored with a mark indicating where to split it.\nIf a tablet does not include such information in the label, FDA has not evaluated it to ensure that the two halves of a split tablet are the same in weight or drug content or work the same way in the body as the whole tablet. You should discuss with your healthcare professional whether to split this type of tablet.\nIf your healthcare professional asks you to split your tablets, do not split the entire supply of tablets at one time and then store them for later use. That is, make sure that both halves are taken before splitting the next tablet. This is important because split tablets may be affected by factors such as heat, humidity and/or moisture content. For example, a split tablet stored in a damp environment such as in a bathroom medicine cabinet could be affected.\nYour healthcare professional may be able to recommend the best method by which to split a tablet. In many cases, a tablet splitter may be appropriate. However, some tablets may not be suitable for this method because of their unique shape and size—even if they appear to be scored. It is important to discuss this issue with your healthcare professional to determine what is best for you.\nMost sustained, controlled, or timed release medications are not meant for splitting. In those rare instances where splitting is recommended for this type of medication, such information will be printed in the “HOW SUPPLIED” section of the professional label insert and in the patient package insert and will be scored.\nWhen you switch from one brand of medicine to another, you and your healthcare professional should confirm whether the newly prescribed tablet is splitable, even if the original tablet could be split. The same medications can be manufactured differently, thus may not have been developed to be split.\n\n\nREMEMBER: Tablet splitting should be done only under the supervision of a healthcare professional."

La enfermedad cardíaca es la causa de muerte principal en la población femenina. La FDA tiene consejos para ayudarle a tomar buenas decisiones acerca de su salud cardíaca.\n1. Consuma una dieta saludable para el corazón.\nLa información nutricional en la etiqueta de los alimentos puede ayudarle a tomar decisiones alimenticias saludables.\n\n\nElija alimentos con ‘bajo contenido de sal’ o ‘bajo contenido de sodio’.\n\n\nLimite los alimentos que tienen ‘grasas trans’. Demasiada grasa trans puede causar infartos.\n\n\nDisminuya el consumo de azúcar. El azúcar también se etiqueta como ‘glucosa’, ‘fructosa’, ‘sacarosa’ y ‘jarabe de maíz’.\n\n\n2. Controle sus problemas de salud.\nLos problemas de salud comunes, como presión arterial alta (hipertensión), diabetes y colesterol alto, pueden aumentar su riesgo de padecer una enfermedad cardíaca.\n\n\nTome sus medicamentos según las instrucciones. No deje de tomar sus medicamentos hasta que su médico se lo indique.\n\n\nSi tiene diabetes, controle su nivel de azúcar en sangre.\n\n\nControle su presión arterial y cholesterol.\n\n\nPregunte a su médico cómo debe controlar sus problemas de salud durante el embarazo.\n\n\nAlgunas mujeres necesitan un dispositivo para ayudar al funcionamiento del corazón. Hable con su médico acerca del dispositivo más adecuado para su problema cardíaco.\n\n\n3. Obtenga información acerca de la aspirina.\nEl uso diario de la aspirina para prevenir un ataque cardíaco o un derrame cerebral no es adecuado para todos.\n\n\nPregunte a su proveedor de atención médica si debe tomar aspirina.\n\n\nSi la aspirina no es adecuada para usted, averigüe:\n\n\nqué cantidad debe tomar\n\n\ncon qué frecuencia debe tomarla\n\n\ncuánto tiempo debe tomar aspirina. Algunos productos combinan aspirina con otros ingredientes y no deben usarse alargo plazo.\n\n\n\n\nInforme a su proveedor de atención médica todos los medicamentos y suplementos que toma. Su riesgo de sangrado puede ser mayor si toma aspirina junto con otros medicamentos, vitaminas o hierbas.\n\n\n4. Conozca los signos de un ataque cardíaco.\nLos signos de un ataque cardíaco pueden ser diferentes para las mujeres y para los hombres.\n\n\nDolor en el pecho (dolor fuerte u opresión)\n\n\nDolor en la parte superior del cuerpo (brazos, cuello, mandíbula, espalda, parte superior del estómago)\n\n\nFalta de aliento\n\n\nSudoración fría repentina\n\n\nCansancio inusual o inexplicable\n\n\nSensación de mareo o aturdimiento\n\n\nMalestar en el estómago (náusea)\n\n\nLlame al 9-1-1 si cree que tiene un ataque cardíaco.\n\n\n\t  La Salud Del Corazón Para Mujeres - Kit de Herramientas de Redes Sociales para Socios\nLa Oficina de Salud de la Mujer de la FDA ofrece recursos para ayudar a las mujeres y los proveedores de atención médica a informarse sobre la salud cardíaca.

High blood pressure is often called a \"silent killer\" because many people have it but don't know it. Over time, people who do not get treated for high blood pressure can get very sick or even die.\nWhat does high blood pressure do to your body?\nHigh blood pressure can cause life-threatening illnesses like kidney problems, stroke, heart failure, blindness, and heart attacks.\nWho is at risk?\nAnyone can have high blood pressure. Some people are more likely to have high blood pressure including:\n\nAfrican Americans\nPeople over age 55\nPeople with a family history of high blood pressure\n\nYour chances of having high blood pressure are higher if you:\n\nAre overweight\nEat foods high in salt\nDo not get regular exercise\nSmoke\nDrink alcohol heavily\n\nWhat are the signs of high blood pressure?\nMany people with high blood pressure do not feel sick at first. The only way to know for sure is to get your blood pressure checked by a doctor or other health professional.\nHow is high blood pressure treated?\nThere are medicines people can take every day to control their high blood pressure. Only your doctor can tell if you need to take medicines.\nUnderstanding your blood pressure: What do the numbers mean?\nWhen you have your blood pressure taken at the doctor, you are told 2 numbers like 120/80. Both numbers are important.\nThe first number is your pressure when your heart beats (systolic pressure). The second number is your pressure when your heart relaxes (diastolic pressure).\nYour blood pressure goes up and down during the day, depending on what you are doing. Brief rises in blood pressure are normal, but the higher your blood pressure stays, the more at risk you are.\nIf your blood pressure is often greater than 140/90, you may need treatment.\nIf your blood pressure is greater than 120/80, and you have other risk factors, like diabetes, you may need treatment.\nHow does high blood pressure affect pregnant women?\nA few women will get high blood pressure when they are pregnant. When pregnant women get high blood pressure, it is called preeclampsia or toxemia.\nHow do I control my high blood pressure?\n\nCheck your blood pressure.\nTake your high blood pressure medicine every day if needed.\nExercise often.\nEat foods low in salt.\nLose weight or keep weight at a healthy level.\nDo not smoke.\nLimit alcohol.\nTalk to your doctor regularly about your pressure.\n\nTo Learn More\n\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\nNHLBI Blood Pressure Information\n\nResources For You\n\nHigh Blood Pressure--Medicines to Help You\nCholesterol Medicines\nWomen and Diabetes\nHeart Health for Women\nGet Other FDA Publications for Women\nFor Women Homepage"

        "content": "La presión arterial alta (también denominada hipertensión) es una enfermedad grave que afecta a casi 65 millones de adultos en los Estados Unidos. La presión arterial alta suele denominarse la \"asesina silenciosa\" porque muchas personas no saben que la tienen. Con el tiempo, quienes no reciben un tratamiento adecuado pueden enfermar gravemente e incluso morir.\n¿Cuáles son los efectos de la presión arterial alta en el cuerpo?\nUn nivel alto de presión arterial puede causar enfermedades que ponen en peligro la vida, tales como problemas en los riñones, accidentes cerebrovasculares (derrame cerebral o apoplejía), insuficiencia cardíaca, ceguera e infartos.\n¿Quiénes están en riesgo?\nCualquier persona puede tener la presión arterial alta. Algunas personas son más propensas a sufrir hipertensión, entre ellas:\n\nPersonas de origen afroamericano\nPersonas mayores de 55 años de edad\nPersonas con antecedentes familiares de presión arterial alta\n\nCorre mayor riesgo de tener presión arterial alta si usted:\n\nPesa demasiado\nConsume alimentos con mucha sal\nNo realiza actividad física de forma habitual\nFuma\nBebe alcohol sin moderación\n\n¿Cuáles son los signos de la hipertensión?\nMuchas personas con presión arterial alta no se sienten enfermas al principio. La única manera de comprobarlo es revisarse la presión arterial por un médico u otro profesional de la salud.\nSepa más sobre su presión arterial: ¿qué significan los números?\n\nCuando el médico le toma la presión arterial, le menciona dos cifras, como por ejemplo 120/80. Ambas son importantes.\nEl primer número es su presión cuando su corazón late (presión sistólica). El segundo número es su presión cuando su corazón se relaja (presión diastólica).\nSu presión arterial sube y baja durante el día, según lo que usted haga.

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download English PDF (538 KB) En Español \nOn this page:\n\nWhat is osteoporosis?\nWhat causes osteoporosis?\nWho gets osteoporosis?\nWho is at risk?\nHow do I know if I have osteoporosis?\nHow is it treated?\nHow do I prevent osteoporosis?\n\nWhat is osteoporosis?\nOsteoporosis is a “silent” bone disease that develops when bone mineral density and bone mass decrease leading to a decrease in bone strength. Bones affected by osteoporosis may become so weak that fractures (broken bones) may occur spontaneously or as a result of a minor fall or normal stresses, such as bending, lifting, or coughing. \nWhat causes osteoporosis?\nIn women, osteoporosis is often caused by bone loss that occurs with the hormonal changes (low levels of estrogen) that come with menopause. Estrogen plays an important role in building and maintaining your bones. After menopause, your body makes very little estrogen.\nThe risk of developing osteoporosis is higher if you did not develop strong bones when you were young. Lack of physical activity, eating disorders, or other health problems can prevent you from building bone mass early in life, leading to less bone mass later. \nWho gets osteoporosis?\nOsteoporosis is a common cause of fractures in postmenopausal women and in older men. It affects more women than men. Of the estimated 10 million Americans with osteoporosis, more than 8 million (80%) are women. In the United States, osteoporosis affects one in four women aged 65 or older, but younger women can also get osteoporosis. \nOsteoporosis affects people of all races and ethnic groups but is most common in non-Hispanic white women and Asian women. Girls and women of all ages need to take steps to protect their bones. \nWho is at risk?\nYou may be more likely to get osteoporosis if you:\n\nAre female\nAre over age 50\nSmoke\nHave a slim, thin body\nHave family members who had osteoporosis \nDo not get enough weight-bearing exercise, such as walking\nDrink alcohol (more than 3 drinks a day)\nHave certain other medical conditions or take certain medicines for a long time\n\nHow do I know if I have osteoporosis?\nOsteoporosis is a “silent” disease because you typically do not have symptoms. You may not even know you have the disease until you break a bone. A fracture can happen in any bone of the body, but fractures from osteoporosis are most common in the hip, wrist, and spine.  \nThere are tests that use either X-rays or ultrasound (sound waves) to measure bone density and can help determine if you have osteoporosis. X-ray tests, called DXA scans, examine your spine, hip, and/or wrist. DXA scans use a very small amount of radiation. Ultrasound tests the condition of the bone but is not used alone for diagnosis of osteoporosis. If the ultrasound indicates that you may have bone loss, you will still need a DXA scan test to diagnose bone loss and osteoporosis.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends osteoporosis screening for women over the age of 65 and for women of any age who have factors that increase the chance of developing osteoporosis. Ask your health care provider if you need a bone density test before age 65.\nHow is osteoporosis treated?\nThere is no way to cure osteoporosis. There are things you can do, listed below, to prevent more bone loss or build new bone mass and strengthen bones. Talk with your health care provider and make a plan to keep your bones healthy.\nLifestyle changes\nThere are lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk for osteoporosis.\n\nStay physically active. Do weight bearing exercise like walking.\nDo not smoke.\nLimit alcohol use.\nGet enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet. Your health care provider may suggest taking calcium and vitamin D pills.\n\nDietary supplements\nDietary supplements are products that people add to their diets. Getting enough vitamins, like vitamin D, and minerals, such as calcium, is important for bone health. Talk with your health care provider before you take any dietary supplements. These may affect your other medicines.\nPrescription medicines\nThere are prescription medicines that you can take. These medicines may come as a pill, a nasal spray, or a shot (injection). \nThe following types of medicines can help treat osteoporosis. Most, but not all, of these medicines have been shown to reduce the risk of bone fracture. Talk with your health care provider about which medicine is right for you:\n\nBisphosphonates\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs\nRANKL inhibitor\nSclerostin inhibitors\nCalcitonin analogs\nSelective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)\n\nAll medicines have potential side effects. Talk with your health care provider about which of these medicines may be right for you. \nIf you are already on a medicine for osteoporosis, talk with your health care provider before you stop taking your medicine.\nHow do I prevent osteoporosis?\nTo help prevent osteoporosis, focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Building strong bones during childhood and the teen years is important to help prevent osteoporosis later in life. Regular check-ups and bone density tests can also be beneficial for early detection and management. \nTalk with your health care provider for advice on osteoporosis prevention based on your age, health, and risk factors.\nHow do I participate in research for osteoporosis?\nClinical trials can help health care providers learn more about treatments for osteoporosis. Visit the Women in Clinical Trials webpage to learn more about how you can participate.\n\nDOWNLOAD - NWHW 2024 Social Media Partner Toolkit which focuses on bone health and osteoporosis.

Los huesos afectados por la osteoporosis pueden debilitarse tanto que pueden producirse fracturas (huesos rotos) de forma espontánea o como consecuencia de una caída leve o de esfuerzos normales, como agacharse, levantar algo o toser. \n¿Cuáles son las causas de la osteoporosis?\nEn las mujeres, la osteoporosis suele ocurrir por la pérdida de masa ósea que se produce con los cambios hormonales (niveles bajos de estrógeno) propios de la menopausia. El estrógeno desempeña un papel importante en la formación y el mantenimiento de los huesos. Después de la menopausia, su cuerpo produce muy poco estrógeno.\nEl riesgo de desarrollar osteoporosis es más alto si no se desarrollaron huesos fuertes durante la juventud. La falta de actividad física, los trastornos alimentarios u otros problemas de salud pueden impedir la formación de masa ósea en una etapa temprana de la vida, lo que implica menos masa en el futuro. \n¿Quiénes padecen osteoporosis?\nLa osteoporosis es una causa frecuente de fracturas en las mujeres posmenopáusicas y en los hombres mayores. Afecta más a las mujeres que a los hombres. De los 10 millones estimados de estadounidenses con osteoporosis, más de 8 millones (el 80%) son mujeres. En Estados Unidos, la osteoporosis afecta a una de cada cuatro mujeres de 65 años o más, pero las más jóvenes también pueden padecerla. \nLa osteoporosis afecta a personas de todas las razas y grupos étnicos, pero es más frecuente en las mujeres blancas no hispanas y en las mujeres asiáticas. Las niñas y las mujeres de todas las edades deben tomar medidas para proteger sus huesos. \n¿Quiénes corren riesgo de tenerla?\nPuede tener más probabilidades de padecer osteoporosis si:\nes mujer;\n\ntiene más de 50 años;\nfuma;\ntiene un cuerpo delgado y esbelto;\ntiene familiares que han tenido osteoporosis; \nno hace suficiente ejercicio en el que soporte su propio peso, como caminar;\nbebe alcohol (más de 3 tragos al día);\npadece otras enfermedades o toma determinados medicamentos hace mucho tiempo.\n\n¿Cómo sé si tengo osteoporosis?\nLa osteoporosis es una enfermedad \"silenciosa\" porque no suele presentar síntomas. Es posible que ni siquiera sepa que tiene la enfermedad hasta que se quiebre un hueso. Una fractura puede producirse en cualquier hueso del cuerpo, pero las fracturas por osteoporosis son más frecuentes en la cadera, las muñecas y la columna vertebral.  \nExisten pruebas que utilizan rayos X o ultrasonido (ondas sonoras) para medir la densidad ósea y pueden ayudar a determinar si padece osteoporosis. Las pruebas con rayos X, denominadas absorciometría de rayos X de energía dual (DXA, por sus siglas en inglés) o densitometría ósea (en Inglés), examinan la columna vertebral, la cadera y las muñecas. La DXA utiliza una cantidad muy pequeña de radiación. La ecografía o ultrasonido comprueba el estado del hueso, pero no se utiliza por sí sola para diagnosticar la osteoporosis. Si la ecografía indica que puede tener pérdida de masa ósea, necesitará una prueba de DXA para diagnosticar esta pérdida de masa ósea y la osteoporosis.\nEl Grupo de Trabajo para Servicios Preventivos de los Estados Unidos (en Inglés) recomienda que se realicen evaluaciones para detectar la osteoporosis a las mujeres mayores de 65 años y las mujeres de cualquier edad que presenten factores que aumenten la probabilidad de desarrollar osteoporosis. Consulte con su proveedor de atención médica si necesita una densitometría ósea antes de los 65 años.\n¿Cómo se trata la osteoporosis?\nNo hay forma de curar la osteoporosis. Hay cosas que puede hacer, que se enumeran a continuación, para prevenir más pérdida de masa ósea o para desarrollar masa nueva y fortalecer los huesos. Hable con su proveedor de atención médica y elaboren un plan para mantener los huesos sanos.\nCambios en el estilo de vida\nHay cambios en el estilo de vida que puede hacer para reducir el riesgo de osteoporosis.\n\nManténgase físicamente activo. Realice ejercicios en los que soporte su propio peso, como caminar.\nNo fume.\nLimite el consumo de alcohol.\nConsuma suficiente calcio y vitamina D en su dieta. Su proveedor de atención médica puede sugerirle que tome pastillas de calcio y vitamina D.\n\nSuplementos nutricionales\nLos suplementos nutricionales son productos que las personas añaden a su dieta. Consumir suficientes vitaminas, como la vitamina D, y minerales, como el calcio, es importante para la salud de sus huesos. Hable con su proveedor de atención médica antes de tomar cualquier suplemento nutricional ya que pueden interferir con los otros medicamentos que toma.\nMedicamentos recetados\nExisten medicamentos recetados que puede tomar. Estos pueden presentarse como pastillas, aerosoles para la nariz o inyecciones. \nLos siguientes tipos de medicamentos pueden ayudar a tratar la osteoporosis. Se ha demostrado que la mayoría de estos medicamentos, aunque no todos, reducen el riesgo de fracturas. Hable con su proveedor de atención médica sobre qué medicamento es el más adecuado para usted:\n\nBifosfonatos\nAnálogos de la hormona paratiroidea (PTH, por sus siglas en inglés)\nInhibidores del ligando de receptor activador para el factor nuclear κ B (RANKL, por sus siglas en inglés)\nInhibidores de esclerostina\nAnálogos de la calcitonina\nModuladores selectivos de los receptores de estrógenos (SERM, por sus siglas en inglés)\n\nTodos los medicamentos pueden tener efectos secundarios. Hable con su proveedor de atención médica sobre cuál de estos medicamentos puede ser adecuado para usted. \nSi ya está tomando un medicamento para la osteoporosis, hable con su proveedor de atención médica antes de dejar de tomarlo.\n¿Cómo se previene la osteoporosis?\nPara ayudar a prevenir la osteoporosis, debe centrarse en mantener un estilo de vida saludable. Fortalecer los huesos durante la infancia y la adolescencia es importante para prevenir la osteoporosis en etapas posteriores de la vida. Las revisiones médicas regulares y las pruebas de densidad ósea también pueden ser beneficiosas para la detección y el tratamiento tempranos. \nHable con su proveedor de atención médica para que le aconseje sobre la prevención de la osteoporosis en función de su edad, su salud y sus factores de riesgo.\n¿Cómo puedo participar en la investigación sobre la osteoporosis?\nLos estudios clínicos pueden ayudar a los proveedores de atención médica a obtener más información sobre los tratamientos para la osteoporosis.

        "content": "UPDATE - May 3, 2023:  The FDA published a new web page with details about over-the-counter (OTC) Hearing Aids: What You Should Know before and after buying an OTC hearing aid.\n\n \n\nHaving trouble hearing? Close to 30 million adults in the United States have some degree of hearing loss. Hearing loss can have a negative effect on communication, relationships, school or work performance, and emotional well-being. However, hearing loss does not have to restrict your daily activities.\n\n\nProperly fitted hearing aids and aural rehabilitation can help in many listening situations. Aural rehabilitation is a patient-centered approach to reduce the impact of hearing loss on communication. Aural rehabilitation helps a person focus on adjusting to hearing loss and how to use their hearing aids. It also explores assistive listening devices to help improve communication. Most people who have hearing impairment will need two hearing aids because both ears are often affected by hearing loss. However, some people may only need one hearing aid.\nThis site includes information on the difference between hearing aids, which are intended for people who have hearing loss, and personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), which are intended for consumers with normal hearing. PSAPs are used to make sounds louder in certain environments, such as during recreational activities like birdwatching or hunting. PSAPs are electronic products, which are products that the FDA regulates under the Electronic Product Radiation Control Program, but they are not medical devices like hearing aids.\nThis site also provides general information on hearing aids, their benefits, types of hearing loss, procedures to improve hearing, and what you should know before and after buying OTC hearing aids. This site is not intended to provide medical advice. If you have questions about your hearing, the best source of information is a hearing health care professional.\nThe options have increased.

        "topic": "Things to Consider when Using a Medical Device in Your Home",
        "content": "The home care setting is a challenging environment. Because it is very different from the hospital setting, it often presents additional risks to patients and providers. This section outlines environmental considerations and potential safety hazards providers and patients should be alert to when using – or considering using – a medical device in the home setting.\nGeographic Location\nWhere a person lives makes a difference in the type of home health care services they receive. For example, home health care providers and support staff may not be readily available in a rural setting, where it may also be difficult to obtain needed back-up supplies or equipment.\nDifferent parts of the country experience power outages more frequently than others, especially during public emergencies like Hurricane Katrina. During these uncontrollable events, patients should have back-up plans and extra supplies when using certain medical devices. FDA provides information about how to handle medical devices during natural disasters and other emergency situations (see Medical Device and Hurricane Emergencies).\nAge and Structure of a Home\nA home’s age and structure can affect the quality of care, especially when using medical devices. For example, older homes may not have the electrical outlets needed for some medical devices. Older homes may also have smaller doorways, hallways, and rooms that do not accommodate large medical equipment. Smaller homes may not allow for wheelchairs to pass through the entranceway, forcing patients to use walkers, crutches, or canes instead.\nBefore a medical device goes home with a patient, check to see if the medical device is compatible with the patient’s home. FDA has developed a checklist with important questions to ask when considering home use medical devices (Home Healthcare Medical Devices: A Checklist) [PDF].\nIn-Home Environmental Hazards\nRegardless of geographic location, home settings may present other environmental challenges for the use of medical devices. These challenges include the following:\n\n\nPets\nPets may directly interfere with device operation. For example, they may chew through an electrical cord or play with an accessory, such as tubing. Pets may also contribute to unsanitary conditions where the medical device is used. They may walk over an area that is supposed to be clean, and pet fur/hair may find its way into a device.\n\n\nUnsanitary Conditions\nUnhealthy conditions may result from dirty surface areas, wet towels on the bathroom floor, dirty dishes, and open or scattered garbage. For example, trash that is not properly contained or removed may attract insects and rodents.\nThe ability to manage medical waste properly and establish safe cleaning practices also requires attention. For instance, the improper disposal of sharps, such as needles, can lead to needlestick injuries in caregivers, patients, and household members. Each state or local government regulates the storage, transportation, and disposal of medical waste. Check with your local government to learn more.\n\n\nChildren at Play\nChildren may interfere with medical device operation. They may change the dial, settings, and on/off switches, twist tubing, adjust machine vents, or remove electrical cords from the outlet. They can also injure themselves while playing with devices they think are toys.\n\n\nPlumbing\nClean, running water is critical to the use of a medical device in the home. Some medical devices and equipment, such as dialyzers or infusion pumps, require safe water during use, cleaning, and maintenance. Even if water is not required for a device to operate, it may be necessary for cleaning its accessories.\n\n\nTemperature Extremes\nExtreme heat and humidity can negatively affect a working device. Unusually high levels of heat and humidity may:\n\nCause instruments to operate in unexpected or unusual ways;\nReduce the expected life span of devices or totally destroy products;\nCause laboratory substances used in chemical analysis to lose strength; or\nCompromise the cleanliness of packaged devices.\n\n\n\nFor example, high humidity becomes a problem when a low flow of air causes moisture to build up on a medical device, resulting in a malfunction. Excess moisture may also cause mold to grow on a device.\n\n\nDust\nCarpets and drapes can hold allergen-containing dust. If dust gets into a medical device, it may affect the way it works.\n\n\nFire Hazards\nFire hazards are a concern when considering a home use medical device. Electrical problems with device equipment such as their potential to overheat or short–circuit may increase the likelihood for home fires. Home care patients who receive supplemental oxygen therapy are also at increased risk. Wherever there is a high concentration of oxygen gas, there is also an increased risk of fire initiated from electrical faults. Taking appropriate fire safety precautions is important.\n\n\nTripping Hazards\nToo much clutter, loose carpeting, and slippery floor surfaces may cause people to fall. Patients who have trouble moving around without the use of a walker, crutch, or cane have a higher risk of falling when these hazards are present.\n\n\nPoor Lighting\nPoor lighting has been shown to result in injuries, especially from patient falls. Inadequate lighting can also make it more difficult for a patient or caregiver to see and operate a medical device.\n\n\nBackground Noise\nThere is a lot of noise in the home environment – from vacuum cleaners, televisions, telephones, to people arguing. Outside noise, such as trash pick-up trucks and emergency sirens, is also common. All loud noise can interfere with the ability to hear whether a medical device is operating correctly or whether an alarm has sounded."

La detección temprana del cáncer de mama puede llevar a opciones de tratamiento tempranas y mejores posibilidades de sobrevivir.\nLas mamografías no pueden encontrar todos los problemas. Llame a su médico o clínica si nota algún cambio en sus senos, lo cual incluye:\n\nun bulto\nengrosamiento\nlíquido que sale del pezón o cambios en el aspecto del pezón\n\n¿Cómo se hace una mamografía?\n\nCuando le hacen una mamografía, usted se pondrá de pie frente a una máquina especial de rayos X.\nDeberá quitarse la camisa y el sostén.\nSu seno se coloca sobre una pequeña plataforma.\nUna placa de plástico transparente presiona el seno durante unos segundos. Es posible que la presión sobre el seno le resulte incómoda. \nEl tecnólogo tomará varias imágenes del seno.\nLuego, un especialista observa las imágenes de rayos X para ver si hay algún cambio en el seno.\n\n¿Cómo obtengo mis resultados?\n\nUsted y su proveedor de atención médica deben recibir los resultados por escrito dentro de los 30 días posteriores a su mamografía.\nLlame si no recibe los resultados. No suponga que todo está normal.\nPida su mamografía. Se puede guardar en un CD. Guárdela para compararla con las mamografías que le hagan más adelante.\n\nCosas que debe saber antes de ir\nSiga estos consejos que le ayudarán a prepararse para su mamografía.\n\nNo use desodorante, perfume, loción o talco debajo de los brazos o en los senos el día del examen. Las partículas externas podrían aparecer en una radiografía.\nInforme al personal si tiene implantes mamarios. Es posible que se deban tomar más imágenes que una mamografía normal.\nTraiga las mamografías anteriores o envíelas al centro si es posible.\nInforme al centro médico si tiene discapacidades físicas que puedan dificultarle sentarse, levantar los brazos, contener la respiración o vestirse. Además, infórmales si utiliza una silla de ruedas o un triciclo motorizado.\nHable con el personal sobre cómo manejarán el asunto del pudor que pueda tener debido a su religión.\n\n\n                                     Difunda el mensaje\nAnime a las mujeres de su familia o comunidad a hacerse mamografías con regularidad. \n \n\nExisten muchas maneras en que puede ayudar a difundir el mensaje.\n\n\nGuía del Lazo Rosa: las mamografías son importantes (en inglés). Obtenga recursos e instrucciones paso a paso para planificar, promover, lanzar y evaluar eventos de sensibilización sobre el Lazo Rosa de la mamografía en su comunidad.  \n\n\n\n\nCómo le ayuda la FDA\nLa Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés) regula las normas para las máquinas de mamografía y la capacitación de las personas que realizan mamografías. Todos los lugares que realizan mamografías en los Estados Unidos tienen que estar certificados según la Ley de Normas de Calidad de Mamografía (MQSA, por sus siglas en inglés). La FDA mantiene una lista de todos los lugares certificados donde puede hacerse una mamografía.\n\nBusque un centro certificado cerca de usted (en inglés)\nLea las notificaciones de inocuidad de las instalaciones de mamografía (en inglés)\nPreguntas frecuentes sobre la MQSA (en inglés)\nLa FDA actualiza las normativas de las mamografías para exigir la presentación de información sobre la densidad mamaria y mejorar la supervisión de las instalaciones (marzo de 2023)\n\nLa FDA proporciona información y recursos para la sensibilización sobre la importancia de las mamografías para la detección del cáncer de mama. Consulte estos recursos que le ayudarán a conocer los datos sobre las mamografías, incluida la diferencia entre mamografías 3D y 2D y más.\n\nMamografía: lo que hay que saber\nPreguntas frecuentes sobre la mamografía digital (en inglés)\nDetección del cáncer de mama: el termograma no sustituye a la mamografía\nQué debe saber sobre los implantes mamarios\n\nInformación en otros idiomas \n\nÁrabe (تصوير الثدي الشعاعي) (PDF, 514 KB) \nChino (乳房X光造影) (PDF, 2.5 MB)\nEnglish (Mammograms) (PDF, 3.13 MB)\nFrancés (mamografías) (PDF, 3.7 KB)\nCriollo haitiano (mamografía) (PDF, 2.4KB)\nJaponés (マンモグラム) (PDF, 2.5 MB)\nCoreano (매모그램) (PDF, 2.5 MB)\nPolaco (mamografía) (PDF, 3.70 MB)\nPortugués (mamografías) (PDF, 3.11 MB)\nRuso (МАММОГРАММЫ) (PDF, 3.71 MB)\nSpanish (Mamografías) (PDF, 2.44 MB)\nTagalo (mamografía) (PDF, 2.4 MB)\nVietnamita (QUANG TUYẾN VÚ) (PDF, 2.4 MB)\n\nEnlaces relacionados\n\nMamografías gratuitas o de bajo costo (CDC) (en español) \nConsejos sobre la detección del cáncer de mama para mujeres con discapacidades (CDC) (en español)\nUna guía para comprender los cambios en los senos (Instituto Nacional del Cáncer [NCI, por sus siglas en inglés]) (en español)\nInformación sobre el cáncer de seno (mama)  (NCI) (en español)"

        "topic": "Colon Cancer Screening",
        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nThe evidence is clear - screening for colorectal cancer may save your life. Today, more and more people are choosing colorectal cancer screening. As a result, there is a steady decline in the number of older people getting and dying from colorectal cancer. Lower rates of smoking among Americans have also contributed to the decline in the past several years.\nColorectal cancer usually starts from polyps or other precancerous growths in the rectum or the colon (large intestine). The only way to find a polyp, precancerous growth, or colorectal cancer is to do a screening test or procedure.\nThe benefits of screening are so great that doctors recommend most people start colorectal cancer screening by age 45. Some people who are at higher risk may need to start screening before age 45.\nYour Colorectal Cancer Screening Choices\nDifferent screening approaches for colorectal cancer have different pros and cons.\n\nFrequency – Some types of screening are better at finding cancer. The gold standard for screening, a colonoscopy, only needs to be done once every 10 years for people at average risk if no precancerous changes are found.\nLocation – Some test samples can be collected in the comfort and privacy of your own home. Other types of screening must be done in a doctor’s office or hospital.\nSedation – Some screening procedures require anesthesia (pain medicine) and sedation. Your doctor will talk with you about your health history and preferences to customize the type of pain medicine and sedation you will need during the procedure.\nColon cleansing – Some screenings require you to take medicine beforehand to clean out all of the stool in your colon and rectum. This cleansing process, sometimes called “bowel prep,” can be uncomfortable and usually means having diarrhea for several hours before the procedure.\nRisks and benefits – Procedures that require sedation and involve a doctor looking at the inside of the colon and rectum have more serious risks. However, the chance of harm during a colorectal cancer screening is small, and the chance of saving your life is high.\nFollow up procedures – Most tests require you to get a colonoscopy, the gold standard for screening, if the first test result is not normal.\n\nMany people find that the temporary discomfort of invasive screening procedure is worth long-term peace-of-mind. Talk to your doctor to figure out which type of screening is best for you.\nColorectal Cancer Screening: FDA-Reviewed and Approved or Cleared\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviews and clears or approves colorectal cancer tests, prescription medicines, and medical devices used during colorectal cancer screening.\nToday there are 2 types of screening recommended for colorectal cancer:\n\nStool (poop) sample tests\nVisual screening procedures such as colonoscopy (doctors use medical devices to look at the inside of your colon and rectum)\n\nOther types of screening can be done, but they are usually recommended only when a stool sample test or visual screening procedure cannot be done. There is an FDA-approved blood test for people who choose not to take a stool sample test or have their doctor do a visual screening procedure.\nStool Sample Tests\nYour doctor can prescribe an at-home stool test. You use the kit to test your stool for blood or DNA (or both) from colorectal cancer. Some types of stool sample tests should be done once a year. Other types should be done at least every 3 years, or more often if your doctor recommends.\nIf the test shows blood or possible DNA from cancer or a precancerous polyp, your doctor will order a colonoscopy or other type of visual screening to get more information.\nVisual Screening\nVisual screening is when a specially trained doctor uses a medical device to look inside of your colon and rectum for polyps or other abnormal growths that may be cancer or precancerous. These procedures usually require colon cleansing or bowel prep the day before. Some types of visual screening require sedation or general anesthesia. Visual screening must be done in a doctor’s office or hospital.\n\nColonoscopy — A doctor uses a thin tube with a light, camera, and surgical tools to look inside the rectum and colon for growths, other abnormal tissue, or cancer. If the doctor sees any precancerous polyps or abnormal growths, he or she can remove the tissue during the procedure. Removing polyps during a colonoscopy usually prevents them from turning into cancer later.\nFlexible Sigmoidoscopy — A doctor uses a thin tube with a light, camera, and surgical tools to look inside the rectum and lower third of the colon for growths, other abnormal areas tissues, or cancer. If the doctor sees any precancerous polyps or abnormal growths, he or she can remove the tissue during the procedure. Removing polyps during a sigmoidoscopy usually prevents them from turning into cancer later.\nCT Colonography (or “Virtual Colonoscopy”) — A series of X-rays, similar to a CT scan, of the colon. The colon will be gently and temporarily inflated with air through a thin tube tip placed in the rectum.\n\n\nDr. Jacqueline Cunkelman, a Medical Officer in the Office of Product Evaluation and Quality in the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health says, “The science is clear—colonoscopy saves lives. Talk to your doctor. Share your fears or concerns about colon cancer screening. Together you can decide which type of screening is best for you.”\n\nSome Minority Groups Are at Higher Risk\nColorectal cancer is more common among certain racial minority groups. For all groups, men are significantly more likely to get and die from colorectal cancer. Compared to non-Hispanic white men and women, Black men and women are at the highest risk of getting and dying from colorectal cancer. American Indian and Alaska Native people are also at higher risk of dying from colorectal cancer.\nRacial and ethnic minority communities have often faced greater barriers to disease prevention, detection, and treatment for many illnesses — and unfortunately, that includes colorectal cancer, said RADM Richardae Araojo, Associate Commissioner for Minority Health and Director of the FDA’s Office of Minority Health and Health Equity. These barriers can include access to health care, access to healthy foods, health insurance status, and transportation just to name a few. “Early detection, referral, and treatment can significantly reduce disparities in deaths from colorectal cancer.”\nColorectal Cancer Rates Are Up Among Adults Under 50\nWhile colorectal cancer rates are falling among older people, rates are going up for adults in their 40s and younger. Cancer of any type is rare in people under 50, but the numbers show that colorectal cancer is no longer just a disease of older adults.\nResearchers aren’t sure why rates are going up in young adults but encourage people of all ages to be aware of significant changes in their bowel habits and stool (poop). Blood in the stool and other stomach problems such as gas, constipation, pain, vomiting, unexplained weight loss or bloating can be a sign of colorectal cancer. But these symptoms can be caused by many different health problems, so it’s best to talk to your doctor or nurse.\nHow Can I Lower My Risk of Colorectal Cancer?\nIn addition to getting screened for colorectal cancer, all of us can lower our risk of developing colorectal cancer with healthy behaviors. Proven behaviors to prevent colorectal cancer include:\n\nPhysical activity – Studies show that getting regular exercise can lower your risk of colorectal cancer by 24%. For substantial health benefits, experts recommend doing 30 to 60 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Exercise can include everyday activities like walking a dog, doing chores around the house, or using the stairs.\nLowering alcohol use – Studies show that drinking 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day increases your risk of colorectal cancer by 41%.\nNot smoking – Studies show that people who smoke have an 18% higher risk of colorectal cancer.\nKeeping a healthy weight – Studies show that women with obesity have a 45% higher risk of getting and dying from colorectal cancer.\n\nFor more information\nFor more information about preventing or screening for colorectal cancer go to the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) website or call NCI’s Cancer Information Service (CIS) at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237)."

En la actualidad, cada vez más personas optan por hacerse una prueba de detección de cáncer colorrectal. Como resultado, el número de personas mayores que padecen y mueren de cáncer colorrectal está disminuyendo de forma constante. La disminución de las tasas de tabaquismo en los estadounidenses también ha contribuido al descenso en los últimos años.\nEl cáncer colorrectal suele empezar por pólipos u otros crecimientos precancerosos en el recto o el colon (intestino grueso). La única forma de detectar un pólipo, un crecimiento precanceroso o un cáncer colorrectal es mediante una prueba o procedimiento de detección.\nLos beneficios de las pruebas de detección son tan grandes que los médicos recomiendan que la mayoría de las personas empiecen a hacerse una prueba de detección de cáncer colorrectal a partir de los 45 años. Algunas personas con mayor riesgo de padecerlo pueden tener que empezar a hacerlo antes de los 45 años.\nSus opciones de pruebas de detección de cáncer colorrectal\nLos distintos métodos de detección de cáncer colorrectal tienen diferentes ventajas y desventajas.\n\nFrecuencia – Algunas pruebas de detección son mejores para detectar el cáncer. El estándar de oro para la detección, una colonoscopia, sólo tiene que realizarse una vez cada 10 años para las personas con un riesgo medio si no se encuentran cambios precancerosos.\nLugar –Algunas muestras de análisis pueden obtenerse en la comodidad y privacidad de su propia casa. Otras pruebas de detección deben realizarse en un consultorio médico u hospital.\nSedación – Algunas pruebas de detección requieren anestesia (medicamentos para el dolor) y sedación. Su médico hablará con usted sobre su historial de salud y sus preferencias para personalizar el tipo de medicamento para el dolor y sedación que necesitará durante el procedimiento.\nLimpieza de colon – Algunas pruebas de detección requieren que tome un medicamento recetado antes del procedimiento para limpiar todas las heces del colon y el recto. Este proceso de limpieza, a veces llamado \"preparación del intestino\", puede ser incómodo y normalmente tendrá diarrea varias horas antes del procedimiento.\nRiesgos y beneficios – Los procedimientos que requieren sedación y en los que el médico examina el interior del colon y el recto tienen riesgos más graves. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de sufrir daños durante una prueba de detección de cáncer colorrectal es pequeña, y la posibilidad de salvar su vida es alta.\nProcedimientos de seguimiento – La mayoría de las pruebas requieren que se realice una colonoscopia, el estándar de oro para la detección, si el resultado de la primera prueba no es normal.\n\nMuchas personas consideran que la incomodidad temporal del procedimiento de detección invasivo vale la pena para tener tranquilidad a largo plazo. Hable con su médico para saber qué prueba de detección es la mejor para usted.\nPruebas de detección de cáncer colorrectal: Revisadas y aprobadas o autorizadas por la FDA\nLa Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los EE. UU. revisa y autoriza o aprueba las pruebas de detección de cáncer colorrectal, los medicamentos recetados y los dispositivos médicos utilizados durante las pruebas de detección de cáncer colorrectal.\nActualmente hay dos pruebas recomendadas para la detección de cáncer colorrectal:\n\nPruebas de muestras de heces (caca) \nProcedimientos de detección visual como la colonoscopia (los médicos utilizan dispositivos médicos para observar el interior de su colon y recto)\n\nSe pueden realizar otros tipos de pruebas de detección, pero normalmente se recomiendan sólo cuando no se puede realizar una prueba de muestras de heces o un procedimiento de detección visual. Existe una prueba de sangre aprobada por la FDA para las personas que optan por no hacerse una prueba de muestras de heces o que se médico realice un procedimiento de detección visual.\nPruebas de muestras de heces\nSu médico puede recetarle una prueba de heces que se realiza en casa. El kit se usa para analizar sus heces en busca de sangre o ADN (o ambos) de cáncer colorrectal. Algunos tipos de pruebas de muestras de heces deben realizarse una vez al año. Otros tipos deben realizarse al menos cada 3 años, o con mayor frecuencia si su médico lo recomienda.\nSi la prueba muestra sangre o posible ADN de cáncer o de un pólipo precanceroso, su médico ordenará una colonoscopia u otro tipo de prueba de detección visual para obtener más información.\nDetección visual\nLa detección visual consiste en que un médico especialista utilice un dispositivo médico para observar el interior del colon y el recto en busca de pólipos u otros crecimientos anormales que puedan ser cancerosos o precancerosos. Estos procedimientos suelen requerir una limpieza de colon o una preparación intestinal el día anterior. Algunos tipos de pruebas de detección visual requieren sedación o anestesia general. La detección visual debe realizarse en el consultorio médico u hospital.\n\nColonoscopia — Un médico utiliza un tubo delgado con una luz, una cámara y herramientas quirúrgicas para observar el interior del recto y el colon en busca de crecimientos, otro tejido anormal o cáncer. Si el médico observa algún pólipo precanceroso o crecimiento anormal, puede extirpar el tejido durante el procedimiento. La extirpación de pólipos durante una colonoscopia suele evitar que se conviertan en cáncer más adelante.\nSigmoidoscopia flexible — El médico utiliza un tubo delgado con una luz, una cámara y herramientas quirúrgicas para observar el interior del recto y el tercio inferior del colon en busca de crecimientos, otros tejidos de áreas anormales o cáncer. Si el médico observa algún pólipo precanceroso o crecimiento anormal, puede extirpar el tejido durante el procedimiento. La extirpación de pólipos durante una sigmoidoscopia suele evitar que se conviertan en cáncer más adelante.\nColonografía por tomografía computada (TC) o (“Colonoscopia virtual”) — Una serie de radiografías, similares a una tomografía computada, del colon. El colon se infla suave y temporalmente con aire a través de la punta de un tubo delgado colocado en el recto.\n\n\nLa Dra. Jacqueline Cunkelman, funcionaria médica de la Oficina de Evaluación y Calidad de Productos  (en inglés) del Centro de Dispositivos y Salud Radiológica de la FDA, afirma: \"La ciencia es clara: la colonoscopia salva vidas. Hable con su médico. Comparta con él sus temores o preocupaciones sobre las pruebas de detección de cáncer de colon. Juntos pueden decidir qué tipo de prueba de detección es la mejor para usted\".\n\nAlgunos grupos minoritarios corren un mayor riesgo\nEl cáncer colorrectal es más común entre ciertos grupos raciales minoritarios. En todos los grupos, los hombres tienen una probabilidad significativamente mayor de padecer y morir de cáncer colorrectal. En comparación con los hombres y mujeres blancos no hispanos, los hombres y mujeres de raza negra tienen el mayor riesgo de padecer y morir de cáncer colorrectal. Los indios americanos y los nativos de Alaska también corren un mayor riesgo de morir a causa de cáncer colorrectal.\nLas comunidades de minorías raciales y étnicas se han enfrentado a menudo a mayores barreras para la prevención, detección y tratamiento de muchas enfermedades y, lamentablemente, eso incluye el cáncer colorrectal, dijo la contraalmirante Richardae Araojo, comisionada asociada para la Salud de las Minorías y directora de la Oficina de Salud de las Minorías y Equidad en Salud (en inglés). Estas barreras pueden incluir el acceso a la atención de la salud, el acceso a alimentos saludables, la situación del seguro médico y el transporte, por nombrar sólo algunas. \"La detección temprana, la derivación y el tratamiento pueden reducir significativamente las disparidades en las muertes por cáncer colorrectal\".\nLas tasas de cáncer colorrectal aumentan entre los adultos menores de 50 años\nAunque las tasas de cáncer colorrectal están disminuyendo entre las personas mayores, las tasas están aumentando entre los adultos de 40 años o menos. El cáncer de cualquier tipo es poco frecuente en personas menores de 50 años, pero las cifras muestran que el cáncer colorrectal ya no es sólo una enfermedad de los adultos mayores.\nLos investigadores no están seguros de por qué las tasas están aumentando en los adultos jóvenes, pero animan a las personas de todas las edades a estar atentas a los cambios significativos en sus hábitos intestinales y en las heces (caca). La sangre en las heces y otros problemas estomacales como gases, estreñimiento, dolor, vómitos, pérdida de peso inexplicable, o hinchazón abdominal pueden ser un signo de cáncer colorrectal. Pero estos síntomas pueden estar causados por muchos problemas de salud diferentes, así que lo mejor es que hable con su médico o enfermera.\n¿Cómo puedo reducir mi riesgo de cáncer colorrectal?\nAdemás de someterse a las pruebas de detección de cáncer colorrectal, todos podemos reducir el riesgo de padecerlo mediante comportamientos saludables. Entre los comportamientos comprobados para prevenir el cáncer colorrectal se encuentran:\n\nActividad física – Los estudios demuestran que hacer ejercicio con regularidad puede reducir el riesgo de cáncer colorrectal en un 24%. Para obtener beneficios sustanciales para la salud, los expertos recomiendan hacer entre 30 y 60 minutos de ejercicio la mayoría de los días de la semana. El ejercicio puede incluir actividades cotidianas como pasear al perro, realizar tareas domésticas o subir escaleras.\nReducir el consumo de alcohol – Los estudios demuestran que tomar 3 o más bebidas alcohólicas al día aumenta el riesgo de cáncer colorrectal en un 41%.\nNo fumar – Los estudios demuestran que las personas que fuman tienen un 18% más de riesgo de cáncer colorrectal.\nMantener un peso saludable – Los estudios demuestran que las mujeres con obesidad tienen un 45% más de riesgo de padecer y morir de cáncer colorrectal.\n\nSi tiene 50 años o más, puede hablar con su médico para saber si tiene ciertos factores de riesgo de padecer enfermedades cardíacas o cáncer colorrectal, y si debería tomar una dosis baja de aspirina para ayudar a prevenir estas enfermedades. Aunque la aspirina es de venta libre, al igual que cualquier otro medicamento, su consumo conlleva riesgos y beneficios. Hable con su médico antes de tomar aspirina para prevenir el cáncer colorrectal o las enfermedades del corazón.\nPara más información\nPara obtener más información sobre la prevención o las pruebas de detección de cáncer colorrectal, visite el sitio web del Instituto Nacional de Cáncer (NCI, por sus siglas en inglés) o llame al Servicio de Información sobre el Cáncer (CIS, por sus siglas en inglés) del NCI al 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237)."

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nYou have flu symptoms, so you’ve been getting some relief by taking a cough and flu medicine every few hours. Late in the day, you have a headache and think about grabbing a couple of acetaminophen tablets (Tylenol, paracetamol and panadol) to treat the pain. Stop right there.\nYou might not realize that more than 600 medications – both prescription and nonprescription (or over-the-counter, OTC) – contain acetaminophen to help relieve pain and reduce fever. Acetaminophen, either alone or in combination, is commonly used to reduce fever, and to relieve pain from headaches, muscle aches, menstrual periods, sore throats, toothaches and backaches.\nBe cautious not to exceed the daily limit of acetaminophen when using a single medicine or combination of medicines containing this drug. Taken carefully and correctly, these medicines can be safe and effective. But taking too much acetaminophen can lead to overdose and severe liver damage.\nSymptoms of acetaminophen overdose may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion and jaundice (yellow skin and eyes). Some people may have no symptoms after an overdose. Symptoms may take several days to appear. And even when they become apparent, these signs may initially mimic flu or cold symptoms. Severe cases may require liver transplantation and can cause death.\nIf you have questions about acetaminophen or any medication, contact the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Division of Drug Information at 1-855-543-3784 and 1-301-796-3400, or druginfo@fda.hhs.gov.\nAcetaminophen Is in Many Products\nEach year in the U.S., people catch 1 billion colds and as many as 12% of people get the flu. Moreover, 7 in 10 people use nonprescription medicines to treat cold, cough and flu symptoms. Acetaminophen is often an ingredient in many medications used to treat these symptoms.\nAcetaminophen is used in many commonly prescribed medications in combination with pain relievers such as codeine, oxycodone and hydrocodone.\nThe current maximum recommended adult dose of acetaminophen is 4,000 milligrams per day for all medicines you might be taking. To avoid exceeding that dose:\n\nBe aware of the number of milligrams of acetaminophen in all the medicines you are taking.\nDon’t take more than one OTC medicine containing acetaminophen.\nDon’t take a prescription and an OTC medicine containing acetaminophen unless advised to do so by your health care professional.\nWhen your health care professional prescribes a drug, ask if it contains acetaminophen, and inform them of all other medicines (prescription and nonprescription) and supplements you take.\n\nWhen you’re deciding which OTC product to buy, read the Drug Facts label to see if the ingredients include acetaminophen, especially before using two or more products at the same time. (For prescription drugs, the ingredients are listed on the container label.)\nThe word “acetaminophen” is not always spelled out in full on the container’s prescription label. Abbreviations – such as APAP, Acetaminoph, Acetaminop, Acetamin and Acetam – may be used instead.\nRely on Health Care Experts\nMake a habit of telling your pharmacist what other medications and supplements you’re taking and asking if taking acetaminophen in addition to them is safe.\nWhen a treatment is intended for children, read the directions section of the Drug Facts label to see if the medicine is right for your child and how much to give. Never guess on a dose. If the dose for your child’s weight or age is not listed on the label and you can’t tell how much to give, ask a health care professional what to do.\nIf you still have pain and fever after treatment, don’t take more than directed. Instead, discuss this with your health care professional. To avoid harm, talk with your health care professional if you have a history of liver disease or drink three or more alcoholic beverages a day.\nHave a Question? Contact FDA’s Drug Information Pharmacists.\nWhen in doubt, reach out to our pharmacists and ask.\n\nBy email: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\nBy phone: 1-855-543-3784 and 1-301-796-3400"

Es una reacción normal al estrés. La ansiedad puede ayudarle a mantenerse alerta ante una situación difícil en el trabajo, a estudiar más para un examen o a concentrarse en una conferencia importante. En general, le ayuda a sobrellevar la situación. Cuando se vuelve difícil de controlar y afecta a la vida cotidiana, puede ser incapacitante. \n¿Qué es un trastorno de ansiedad?\nLos trastornos de ansiedad se producen cuando la ansiedad excesiva interfiere en las actividades cotidianas, como ir al trabajo o al colegio, o pasar tiempo con los amigos o la familia. Los trastornos de ansiedad son enfermedades mentales graves. \nLos trastornos de ansiedad son los trastornos mentales más frecuentes en los Estados Unidos. Afectan a más de 40 millones de adultos estadounidenses cada año. Las mujeres tienen más del doble de probabilidades que los hombres de desarrollar un trastorno de ansiedad en algún momento de su vida. Los trastornos de ansiedad son altamente tratables, pero menos del 37% de quienes los padecen reciben tratamiento.\n¿Cuáles son los principales tipos de trastornos de ansiedad? \nExisten varios tipos principales de trastornos de ansiedad. Todos tienen sus propias características e influyen en las personas de distintas maneras. \n\nEl trastorno de ansiedad generalizada (GAD, por sus siglas en inglés) causa una preocupación excesiva por aspectos habituales de la vida, como la familia o los ingresos. Puede ocurrir a diario y hacer difícil sobrellevar el día o dormir por la noche. El GAD a menudo coexiste con la depresión severa.\nEl trastorno de pánico consiste en ataques de pánico frecuentes y repentinos, que son sensaciones inesperadas de terror que suceden sin previo aviso. Los ataques de pánico pueden producirse cuando no existe un peligro directo. \nLas fobias son un miedo intenso a algo que no supone ninguna amenaza. Esto puede incluir viajar en avión o estar rodeado de un grupo grande de personas.\n\n¿Cuáles son los síntomas de los trastornos de ansiedad?\nLos trastornos de ansiedad vienen acompañados de una variedad de síntomas. Pueden variar según la persona y el tipo de trastorno de ansiedad que padezca. Los síntomas también pueden afectar a la forma de vivir y de pasar el tiempo con los demás.\nHay muchos síntomas de ansiedad. Los síntomas que se describen a continuación son comunes a varios tipos de trastornos de ansiedad:\n\nPensamientos o creencias ansiosas\nSentimientos de miedo y temor\nSíntomas físicos como taquicardia o náuseas\nCambios en el comportamiento como evitar actividades que antes eran normales \n\n¿Cuáles son las causas de los trastornos de ansiedad?\nVarios factores pueden aumentar el riesgo de desarrollar un trastorno de ansiedad. Pueden variar de una mujer a otra. Algunos de los factores de riesgo más comunes son:\n\nAcontecimientos traumáticos en la infancia o en la edad adulta\nCambios hormonales durante el ciclo menstrual\nAntecedentes familiares de ansiedad u otros trastornos mentales\n\n¿Cuáles son las opciones de tratamiento comunes?\nPara algunas personas, el tratamiento puede ayudar a aliviar los síntomas de ansiedad. Existen varios tipos de tratamientos para la ansiedad que le ayudarán a controlar sus síntomas a diario, como: \nAsesoramiento (psicoterapia o terapia de conversación) \n\nEsta forma de tratamiento implica hablar con un profesional de la salud mental cualificado. Juntos pueden trabajar para controlar la ansiedad.\n\nMedicamentos\n\nLos medicamentos no curan los trastornos de ansiedad, pero pueden ayudar a aliviar los síntomas. Los proveedores de atención médica pueden recetar medicamentos para la ansiedad. Las clases de medicamentos más utilizadas para combatir los trastornos de ansiedad son los antidepresivos, los ansiolíticos (como las benzodiacepinas) y los betabloqueantes.\n\nHable con su proveedor de atención médica para saber qué tratamiento es el más adecuado para usted. También debe hablar con su proveedor sobre los riesgos, beneficios y efectos secundarios antes de iniciar o interrumpir un tratamiento médico.\n¿Cómo afecta mi salud física a mi salud mental?\nLas personas que no están sanas físicamente pueden tener problemas para mantenerse sanas mentalmente. Las personas que padecen problemas de salud crónicos (de larga duración), como diabetes o enfermedades del corazón, suelen tener mayores niveles de estrés y ansiedad. Tener una enfermedad crónica no siempre significa que se vaya a padecer un trastorno de salud mental como un trastorno de ansiedad, pero si está luchando contra ambos, sepa que no está solo. Los grupos de apoyo y los profesionales de la salud pueden ayudar. Una alimentación sana y otros hábitos saludables, como el ejercicio, el yoga o la meditación, pueden ayudar a mejorar la salud física y reducir la ansiedad.\n¿Qué debe hacer si cree que padece un trastorno de ansiedad?\nPrograme una visita con un proveedor de atención médica. En esta visita, su médico de atención primaria realizará un examen inicial de su salud mental. A continuación, su médico puede remitirle a un especialista en salud mental.\nParticipe en su cuidado. Hable abiertamente de sus síntomas y escuche sus opciones. Dé su opinión sobre las opciones que cree que podrían ser beneficiosas para usted. \nAcuda a personas de confianza en busca de apoyo. Al enfrentarse a la vida con un trastorno de ansiedad, resulta útil contar con personas de confianza. Busque amigos y grupos de apoyo que sepa que escucharán sus preocupaciones y le ayudarán en los momentos difíciles. \nLlame o envíe un mensaje de texto a la Línea de Ayuda en caso de Suicidio y Crisis/Suicide and Crisis Lifeline al 988 si tiene preocupaciones inmediatas sobre su salud mental. La Línea de Ayuda/Lifeline ofrece ayuda gratuita y confidencial 24 horas al día, 7 días a la semana, a personas en dificultad, y recursos de prevención y crisis para usted o sus seres queridos en los Estados Unidos. Llame al 911 si usted o alguien que conoce se encuentra en peligro inmediato o acuda a la sala de emergencias más cercana.\n¿Qué hay que saber sobre los trastornos de ansiedad y el embarazo?\nSi está pensando en quedar embarazada, está embarazada o en período de lactancia, debe hablar con su proveedor de atención médica sobre qué medicamento puede tomar para la ansiedad. Algunos medicamentos pueden afectar al feto, pero las enfermedades mentales no tratadas también pueden afectar al feto. Algunos medicamentos también pueden pasar al bebé a través de la leche materna. Hable con su proveedor sobre qué tratamientos son seguros para usted y su bebé.\nDurante el embarazo o como madre primeriza, es posible que a veces se sienta abrumada. La Línea Nacional de Salud Mental Materna ofrece apoyo y recursos de salud mental. Es gratuito, confidencial y está disponible 24 horas al día, 7 días a la semana.

Converse sobre sus riesgos y beneficios. Su proveedor puede responder a todas sus preguntas. Juntos podrán decidir qué tratamiento es el más adecuado para usted.\nCampaña Mujeres Diversas en Estudios Clínicos \nLos ensayos clínicos son estudios de investigación que proporcionan información sobre la seguridad y eficacia de nuevos tratamientos. Esto incluye los medicamentos para tratar la ansiedad. Es importante que en los ensayos clínicos participen mujeres de diversos orígenes. Puede llevar a más opciones de tratamiento que funcionen para todas las mujeres.

You can also chat at 988lifeline.org to speak with a trained crisis counselor.\n\nJuly is National Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. It is a time to bring awareness to the unique challenges that racial and ethnic minorities in the United States face when it comes to mental illness. In 2020, fewer than one in every two African American adults got care for mental health. In 2018, Asian Americans were 60 percent less likely to receive mental health treatment than non-Hispanic Whites. Obstacles for many include a lack of health insurance, less access to treatment, and stigma.\nMental illness can affect women of all races and ethnicities. Show your support this month and beyond by learning more about mental health. You can also use and share the resources below to help spread awareness about mental health in your communities and families. \nWhat Is Mental Health?\nMental health includes emotional, mental, and social well-being. Mental health impacts how a person thinks and feels. It also affects how you act, manage stress, and make choices. When you take care of your mental health, you are better able to cope with stress or challenges. \nSometimes it can be hard to manage  your mental health. If you have noticed a change in thoughts, behaviors, or moods that disrupts your life, talk to your health care provider. You can also contact a mental health specialist or a trusted loved one for help if you have noticed these changes in yourself or in a loved one. \n \n\nWhat Causes Mental Illness?\nThere is no single cause for mental illness. Multiple mental illnesses can occur at the same time and at random. They can also last for a short or long period of time.  \nYour mental health can change at any point. Some risk factors that can play a role in developing mental illness include:\n\nUse of alcohol or drugs\nFeeling lonely or isolated\nBiological factors or chemical imbalances in the brain\nAdverse childhood experiences, like child abuse or sexual assault\nExperiences tied to ongoing medical conditions, like cancer or diabetes\n\nSymptoms of a Mental Illness\nMost of the same mental illnesses can develop in both men and women. However, women may have more distinct symptoms.\nSome common symptoms can include:\n\nPulling away from people and usual activities\nAppetite or weight changes\nOngoing sadness or feelings of hopelessness\nIntense changes in eating or sleeping habits\nClear changes in mood, energy level, or appetite\n\n \n\nMental Illnesses Common to Women\nHaving a mental illness is more common than most people may think. At least one in five women in the United States has had a mental illness at some point. Those that are common in women include depression and anxiety. Postpartum depression can develop after giving birth. \nRead more about mental illnesses common to women below.\nAnxiety Disorders in Women \nWhile they can happen to anyone, anxiety disorders are twice as likely to occur in women than men. Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or fear about an event or situation. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress and helps you cope. But when it gets hard to control and affects day-to-day life, it can be disabling. Anxiety disorders happen when extreme anxiety affects your daily activities, such as going to work or school or spending time with friends and family. \nSigns of an anxiety disorder include anxious thoughts or feelings of dread. The symptoms can keep you from living as you normally would.\nDepression in Women\nStudies show that about 1 in 10 women in the United States reported symptoms that suggest they experienced an episode of major depression in the last year, and women are nearly twice as likely as men to have had depression. It is normal to feel sad at times. However, depression can cause people to feel sad on most days. This can affect your daily life and how you engage with your loved ones.\nCertain types of depression are unique to women and can occur at different stages of a woman’s life. Pregnancy, the postpartum period, perimenopause, and the menstrual cycle are all associated with physical and hormonal changes that could impact your mental health. If you have depression and get pregnant, your depression may get worse during pregnancy.  \nThere are many signs of depression. A few of them include feeling sad, hopeless, or tired most of the time. Speak with your health care provider if you have noticed signs of depression. You can discuss next steps and treatment options with your health care provider. \nMore Than Just the Baby Blues: Postpartum Depression  \nIt is normal for some women to feel sad or have no emotion after giving birth. But if such feelings last more than two weeks, you may have postpartum depression. This can happen up to a year after giving birth. Once you give birth, your hormone levels quickly drop back to normal. The decrease can be sudden and extreme, which can lead to this condition. \nPostpartum depression is not a normal part of life after giving birth. If you notice signs of this condition, speak to your health care provider. You can also call the National Maternal Mental Health Hotline. It offers free and confidential support for new mothers. Call or text the hotline at 1-833-TLC-MAMA (1-833-852-6262). \nManaging Your Mental Health \nMany parts of daily life can impact your mood and mental health. They can include stress, your physical health, or the regular demands of life. But you can improve your quality of life when you take charge of your mental health.\nHere are a few ways to manage your mental health overall:\n\nGet enough sleep each night (at least 7 hours)\nEngage in healthy habits, like exercising and eating well\nStick to a treatment plan given by your health care provider\nFind a support group and seek out your health care provider for support \n\nToday, good mental health is achievable thanks to many forms of support. Share the resources in this blog to spread awareness of the importance of good mental health and to help ensure that everyone has equal access to the mental health resources they need. You can also use the blog as a source to find tools to help you manage your mental health.

Esta página no pretende guiar la práctica clínica. La información sobre los productos y los riesgos puede cambiar. Lea la etiqueta del producto y hable con su proveedor de atención médica para obtener más información sobre los riesgos de un producto específico o sobre la posibilidad de quedar embarazada mientras usa un anticonceptivo.\n\t\n\nLa FDA regula los productos anticonceptivos que son dispositivos médicos o medicamentos. La FDA aprueba, autoriza y concede autorización de comercialización a estos productos para el control de la natalidad (anticonceptivos) cuando se demuestra que son seguros y efectivos (funcionan bien para prevenir el embarazo).\nLa página web de control de la natalidad y la tabla imprimible en formato PDF proporcionan información de alto nivel sobre las diferentes opciones de control de la natalidad. Ambas tienen fines educativos para el público en general. Esta tabla no pretende ser una lista completa de todas las opciones de control de la natalidad disponibles. Hable con su proveedor de atención médica sobre la mejor opción de control de la natalidad para usted.\nSi no quiere quedar embarazada, hay muchas opciones de control de la natalidad entre las que elegir. Ningún producto es el mejor para todas las personas. Algunos tipos de anticonceptivos son mejores que otros para prevenir el embarazo. La única forma segura de evitar el embarazo es no tener relaciones sexuales. \nTipos de control de la natalidad\n\nEsterilización permanente \nAnticonceptivos reversibles de acción prolongada (LARC, por sus siglas en inglés)\nInyección anticonceptiva\nAnticonceptivos hormonales de acción corta\nAplicación de software para el control de la natalidad\nAnticonceptivos de barrera\nAnticonceptivos de emergencia\n\nAlgunas cosas en las que pensar cuando elija un método anticonceptivo:\n\nSu salud.\nSi quiere tener hijos en el futuro. \nCon qué frecuencia tiene relaciones sexuales.\nCuántas parejas sexuales tiene.\nSi necesitará una receta o si puede comprar el anticonceptivo sin receta.\n\nEsta página enumera las tasas de embarazo basadas en el número de embarazos esperados por cada 100 mujeres que usan un método anticonceptivo en un año. En comparación, alrededor de 85 de cada 100 mujeres sexualmente activas que no utilizan ningún método anticonceptivo pueden esperar quedar embarazadas en un año. Estas tasas de embarazo pueden ayudarle a comprender qué tan efectivos son los diferentes métodos durante el uso real (incluso a veces el uso de un método de una manera incorrecta o no consistente).\nPara obtener más información sobre la posibilidad de quedar embarazada mientras usa un método anticonceptivo o sobre los riesgos de un producto específico, consulte la etiqueta del producto o referencias como Bradley SEK, et al., Efectividad, seguridad y efectos secundarios comparativos.

Si no lo hace, aumenta sus posibilidades de quedar embarazada.\nLa única forma segura de evitar el embarazo es no tener relaciones sexuales.\n\n\nEsterilización permanente\nCirugía de esterilización para mujeres (también llamada esterilización quirúrgica transabdominal)\nLa cirugía de esterilización es para mujeres que están seguras de que no quieren tener un hijo o más hijos. La cirugía de esterilización puede no ser adecuada para usted si no está segura de si quiere tener hijos o no.  A veces es posible revertir la esterilización. La reversión implica otra cirugía que podría no tener éxito. \n \n\n¿Qué es?\n\nEs una cirugía que una mujer necesita solo una vez.\nEs permanente.\nUna forma es atar y cortar las trompas de falopio, lo que se denomina ligadura de trompas.\nLas trompas de Falopio también se pueden sellar usando un instrumento con corriente eléctrica.\nTambién se pueden cerrar con clips, abrazaderas o anillos.\n\n¿Como funciona?\n\nSe bloquean las trompas de Falopio para que el óvulo y el esperma no puedan encontrarse en la trompa de Falopio. Esto evita que quede embarazada.\n\n¿Como la obtengo?\n\nEs una cirugía.\nNecesitará anestesia general.\n\nProbabilidad de quedar embarazada con el uso (número de embarazos esperados en un año por cada 100 mujeres que usan este método anticonceptivo)\n\nDe cada 100 mujeres que se someten a esta cirugía, menos de 1 puede quedar embarazada.\n\nAlgunos riesgos\n\nSangrado\nInfección u otras complicaciones después de la cirugía\nDolor\n\n¿Proporciona protección contra las infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS)? No. \n\nCirugía de esterilización para hombres (vasectomía)\nLa cirugía de esterilización es para hombres que están seguros de que no quieren tener un hijo o más hijos. La vasectomía puede no ser adecuada para usted si no está seguro de si quiere tener hijos o no. A veces es posible revertir la operación, pero la probabilidad de una reversión exitosa disminuye cuanto más tiempo pasa entre la vasectomía y la reversión.  La reversión implica una cirugía complicada que podría no funcionar.\n \n\n¿Qué es?\n\nEs una cirugía que un hombre necesita solo una vez.\nEs permanente.\n\n¿Como funciona?\n\nLa cirugía bloquea los conductos deferentes de un hombre (los conductos que transportan el esperma desde los testículos).\nDespués de esta cirugía, el semen (el líquido que sale del pene de un hombre) no contiene espermatozoides.\nUn hombre tarda unos tres meses en eliminar los espermatozoides de su sistema.  Deberá usar otro método anticonceptivo hasta que una prueba muestre que ya no hay espermatozoides en el líquido seminal.\n\n¿Como la obtengo?\n\nEs una cirugía.\nSe utiliza anestesia local.\n\nProbabilidad de quedar embarazada con el uso (número de embarazos esperados en un año por cada 100 mujeres cuya pareja usa este método anticonceptivo)\n\nDe cada 100 mujeres cuya pareja se ha hecho una vasectomía, menos de 1 puede quedar embarazada.\n\nAlgunos riesgos\n\nSangrado\nInfección\nDolor\n\nEl éxito de la cirugía de reversión depende de:\n\nEl tiempo transcurrido desde que se realizó la vasectomía.\nSi se han desarrollado o no anticuerpos contra los espermatozoides.\nEl método quirúrgico utilizado para la vasectomía.\nLa longitud y ubicación de los segmentos de los conductos deferentes que se extirparon o bloquearon.\n\n¿Proporciona protección contra las infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS)?

Consta de una vaina de nitrilo (sin látex), un anillo exterior flexible más grande y un anillo interior de poliuretano que se coloca en la vagina. El nitrilo también se usa comúnmente para fabricar guantes quirúrgicos.\n\n¿Como lo uso?\n\nColoque el condón interno en la vagina antes de tener relaciones sexuales.\nSiga las instrucciones del paquete para asegurarse de que el pene permanezca dentro del condón durante las relaciones sexuales y no se mueva fuera del condón.\nÚselo solo una vez y luego deséchelo.\n\n¿Como lo consigo?\n\nNo necesita receta médica.\nPuede comprarlo sin receta o en línea.\n\nProbabilidad de quedar embarazada con el uso (número de embarazos esperados por cada 100 mujeres que usan este método anticonceptivo durante un año)\n\nDe cada 100 mujeres que usan este anticonceptivo, unas 21 pueden quedar embarazadas.\nLo más importante es que use un condón nuevo cada vez que tenga relaciones sexuales.\n\nAlgunos riesgos\n\nSensación de ardor, sarpullido, o picazón\nMalestar o dolor durante la inserción o las relaciones sexuales\n\n¿Proporciona protección contra las infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS)?\n\nSí. Cuando se usa en la vagina, el condón interno reduce los riesgos de algunas ITS. El condón no puede proporcionar una protección absoluta contra las ITS.\n\n\n \n\nAnticonceptivos vaginales antiesperma (incluye espermicidas y otros agentes antiesperma)\nAlgunos, pero no todos, los anticonceptivos vaginales antiespermatozoides son espermicidas\n¿Qué es?\n\nUna espuma, crema, jalea, película o tableta que se coloca en la vagina.\n\n¿Como lo uso?\n\nDebe colocar el anticonceptivo vaginal antiesperma en la vagina antes de tener relaciones sexuales. Los productos disponibles difieren en qué tan temprano puede colocar el anticonceptivo y cuánto durará el anticonceptivo. \nLas instrucciones pueden ser diferentes para cada tipo de anticonceptivo vaginal antiesperma. Lea la etiqueta cuidadosamente antes de usar el anticonceptivo vaginal anti-esperma.\nNo se dé duche vaginales ni enjuague la vagina durante al menos 6 horas después de tener relaciones sexuales.\nAlgunos productos se pueden usar con un condón, un diafragma o un capuchón cervical para brindar una mejor protección contra el embarazo. Las mujeres deben consultar a su proveedor de atención médica para determinar si el producto antiesperma que están usando se puede usar con un anticonceptivo de barrera específico (condón, diafragma o capuchón cervical).\n\n¿Como lo consigo?\n\nPuede comprar algunos productos sin receta, pero para otros necesitará una receta médica.\n\nProbabilidad de quedar embarazada con el uso (número de embarazos esperados por cada 100 mujeres que usan este método anticonceptivo durante un año)\n\nDe cada 100 mujeres que usan estos anticonceptivos, entre 21 y 28 pueden quedar embarazadas.\nLos estudios con diferentes productos muestran diferentes tasas de efectividad.\n\nAlgunos riesgos\n\nReacciones alérgicas\nLos espermicidas que contienen N9 (nonoxinol-9) pueden irritar la vagina y el recto, lo que puede aumentar el riesgo de contraer el VIH (el virus que causa el SIDA) de una pareja infectada.\nInfección del tracto urinario\n\n¿Proporciona protección contra las infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS)? No.\n\nAnticonceptivos de emergencia \nSe puede usar si no usó un método anticonceptivo o si su método anticonceptivo regular falló (por ejemplo, si se rompe un condón). No debe usarse como una forma regular de control de la natalidad.\nLevonorgestrel 1.5 mg (1 píldora)  \n \n\n¿Qué es? \n\nEs una sola píldora que contiene una hormona progestina.\nAyuda a prevenir el embarazo después de una falla en el control de la natalidad o sexo sin protección.\n\n¿Como funciona? \n\nFunciona antes de la liberación de un óvulo del ovario. Como resultado, generalmente detiene o retrasa la liberación de un óvulo del ovario.\nPara tener la mejor oportunidad de que funcione, debe tomar la píldora lo antes posible dentro de las 72 horas posteriores a la relación sexual sin protección o si hubo una falla en el   control de la natalidad.\n\n¿Como la consigo?\n\nPuede comprarla sin receta. No necesita receta médica.\n\nProbabilidad de quedar embarazada \n\nUn estudio grande mostró que 7 de cada 8 mujeres que habrían quedado embarazadas no quedaron embarazadas después de tomar un anticonceptivo de emergencia; otros estudios han mostrado tasas más bajas de prevención del embarazo.\n\nAlgunos efectos secundarios\n\nDolor en los senos\nDolor de cabeza, náuseas, vómitos, mareos\nDolor en la parte baja del estómago (abdominal)\nCambios menstruales\nCansancio\n\n¿Proporciona protección contra las infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS)?

        "topic": "Safely using sharps (needles and syringes) at home, at work and on travel",
        "content": "Sharps is a medical term for devices with sharp points or edges that can puncture or cut skin. They may be used at home, at work, and while traveling to manage the medical conditions of people or their pets, including allergies, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, infertility, migraines, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, blood clotting disorders, and psoriasis.\n \n\nExamples of sharps include:\n\nNeedles – hollow needles used to inject drugs (medication) under the skin\nSyringes – devices used to inject medication into or withdraw fluid from the body\nLancets, also called “fingerstick” devices – instruments with a short, two-edged blade used to get drops of blood for testing. Lancets are commonly used in the treatment of diabetes.\nAuto Injectors, including epinephrine and insulin pens – syringes pre-filled with fluid medication designed to be self-injected into the body\nInfusion sets – tubing systems with a needle used to deliver drugs to the body.\nConnection needles/sets – needles that connect to a tube used to transfer fluids in and out of the body. This is generally used for patients on home hemodialysis.\n\nHow to Dispose of Sharps\nUsed sharps should be immediately placed in a sharps disposal container. FDA-cleared sharps containers are generally available through pharmacies, medical supply companies, health care providers and online. These containers are made of puncture-resistant plastic with leak-resistant sides and bottom. They also have a tight fitting, puncture-resistant lid.\nIf an FDA-cleared container is not available a heavy-duty plastic household container, such as a laundry detergent container can be used as an alternative.\nImportance of Safe Sharps Disposal\nUsed needles and other sharps are dangerous to people and pets if not disposed of safely because they can injure people and spread infections that cause serious health conditions. The most common infections are:\n\nHepatitis B (HBV),\nHepatitis C (HCV), and\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).\n\nSafe sharps disposal is important whether you are at home, at work, at school, traveling, or in other public places such as hotels, parks, and restaurants.\nNever place loose needles and other sharps (those that are not placed in a sharps disposal container) in the household or public trash cans or recycling bins, and never flush them down the toilet. This puts trash and sewage workers, janitors, housekeepers, household members, and children at risk of being harmed.\nPet owners who use needles to give medicine to their pets should follow the same sharps disposal guidelines used for humans.\nWhat to Do If You Are Accidently Stuck By a Used Needle or Other Sharp\nIf you are accidently stuck by another person’s used needle or other sharp:\n\nWash the exposed area right away with water and soap or use a skin disinfectant (antiseptic) such as rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer.\nSeek immediate medical attention by calling your physician or local hospital.\n\nFollow these same instructions if you get blood or other bodily fluids in your eyes, nose, mouth, or on your skin.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nSafe Needle Disposal\n\tFor more information about proper disposal methods for sharps used outside of health care settings visit this website or call (800) 643-1643\nStop Sticks Campaign – Sharps-Related Injury Prevention among Health Care Workers\n\n\nRelated Links\n\nFinal Order - Reclassification of Blood Lancets\nFinal Order - Effective Date of Requirement for Premarket Approval for Blood Lancets\nProposed Order - Effective Date of Requirement for Premarket Approval for Blood Lancets\nProposed Order - Blood Lancets; Reclassification\nFDA Flickr Slideshow\nDOs and DON'Ts of Proper Sharps Disposal: Printable Version (PDF - 120KB)\nHow to Get Rid of a Sharps Container: Printable Version (PDF - 136KB)"

        "topic": "Recommendations for consumers and caregivers about adult portable bed rails",
        "content": "Some people are at a high-risk for entrapment, falls or other injury from adult portable bed rails. High-risk people include those with pre-existing conditions such as confusion, restlessness, lack of muscle control, or a combination of these factors. Additionally, people who are cognitively impaired from the use of medication or from a medical condition, such as Alzheimer's or dementia, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), balance disorders, stroke, or low blood pressure (hypotension), are at a higher risk of entrapment and injury.\n\nConsider other alternatives when bed rails are not appropriate. Alternatives include roll guards, foam bumpers, lowering the bed as near to the floor as possible, using concave mattresses that can help reduce rolling off the bed, or a bed trapeze to help reposition while in bed and to get in and out of bed.\nAdult portable bed rails should not be used as a substitute for proper monitoring, especially for people at high risk for entrapment and falls.\nIf your loved one is in a long-term care facility, make sure that a comprehensive assessment and care plan is in place before using bed rails (see information under Recommendations for Health Care Providers).\n\nThe FDA recommends the following actions to prevent deaths and injuries from entrapment and falls from adult portable bed rails:\nBefore you install bed rails:\n\nCheck whether the adult portable bed rails you are using comply with ASTM F3186-17: Standard Specification for Adult Portable Bed Rails and Related Products. This FDA-recognized international consensus standard establishes performance criteria for adult portable bed rails including resistance to entrapment.\nBe aware that not all bed rails, mattresses, and bed frames are interchangeable and not all bed rails fit all size beds.\nCheck with the manufacturers to make sure the bed rails, mattress, and bed frame are compatible, since most bed rails and mattresses are purchased separately from the bed frame.\nRails should be selected and placed to discourage climbing over rails to get in and out of bed, which could lead to falls.\n\nWhen installing and using bed rails:\n\nConfirm that the age, size, and weight of the person using the bed rails are appropriate for the bed rails used.\nInstall bed rails using the manufacturer's instructions to ensure a proper fit.\nEnsure that the safety strap or bed rail retention system is permanently attached to the rail and secured to the bed frame according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nRegularly inspect the mattress and bed rails for gaps and areas of possible entrapment. Regardless of mattress width, length, and depth, the bed frame, bed rail and mattress should leave no gap wide enough to entrap a patient's head or body.\nUse caution when using bed rails with a soft mattress as this may increase risk of entrapment between the mattress and bed rail.\nBe aware that gaps can be created by movement or compression of the mattress which may be caused by patient weight, patient movement or bed position, or by using a specialty mattress, such as an air mattress, mattress pad or waterbed.\nCheck bed rails regularly to make sure they are still installed correctly as rails may shift or loosen over time.\nWhen in doubt, call the manufacturer of the bed rails for assistance."

        "topic": "Hearing aids",
        "content": "UPDATE - May 3, 2023:  The FDA published a new web page with details about over-the-counter (OTC) Hearing Aids: What You Should Know before and after buying an OTC hearing aid.\n\n \n\nHaving trouble hearing? Close to 30 million adults in the United States have some degree of hearing loss. Hearing loss can have a negative effect on communication, relationships, school or work performance, and emotional well-being. However, hearing loss does not have to restrict your daily activities.\n\n\nProperly fitted hearing aids and aural rehabilitation can help in many listening situations. Aural rehabilitation is a patient-centered approach to reduce the impact of hearing loss on communication. Aural rehabilitation helps a person focus on adjusting to hearing loss and how to use their hearing aids. It also explores assistive listening devices to help improve communication. Most people who have hearing impairment will need two hearing aids because both ears are often affected by hearing loss. However, some people may only need one hearing aid.\nThis site includes information on the difference between hearing aids, which are intended for people who have hearing loss, and personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), which are intended for consumers with normal hearing. PSAPs are used to make sounds louder in certain environments, such as during recreational activities like birdwatching or hunting.

Food illnesses can also cause serious health problems, even death. Follow these four steps to help keep you and your family safe.\n4 basic steps for food safety\n1. Clean: always wash your food, hands, counters, and cooking tools.\n\nWash hands in warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds. Do this before and after touching food.\nWash your cutting boards, dishes, forks, spoons, knives, and counter tops with hot soapy water. Do this after working with each food item.\nRinse fruits and veggies.\nDo not wash meat, poultry, fish, or eggs. If water splashes from the sink in the process of washing, it can spread bacteria.\nClean the lids on canned goods before opening.\n\n2. Separate (keep apart):  keep raw foods to themselves. Germs can spread from one food to another.\n\nKeep raw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs away from other foods. Do this in your shopping cart, bags, and fridge.\nDo not reuse marinades used on raw foods unless you bring them to a boil first.\nUse a special cutting board or plate for raw foods only.\n\n3. Cook: foods need to get hot and stay hot. Heat kills germs.\n\nCook to safe temperatures:\n\t\nBeef, Pork, Lamb 145 °F\nFish 145 °F\nGround Beef, Pork, Lamb 160 °F\nTurkey, Chicken, Duck 165 °F\n\n\nUse a food thermometer to make sure that food is done. You can’t always tell by looking.\n\n4. Chill: put food in the fridge right away. \n\n2-Hour Rule: Put foods in the fridge or freezer within 2 hours after cooking or buying from the store. Do this within 1 hour if it is 90 degrees or hotter outside.\nNever thaw food by simply taking it out of the fridge. Thaw food:\n\t\nIn the fridge\nUnder cold water\nIn the microwave\n\n\nMarinate foods in the fridge.\n\n\n\nThink you have a food illness?\nCall your health care provider and get medical care right away.\n\nSave the food package, can, or carton. Then report the problem.\nCall USDA at 1-888-674-6854 if you think the illness was caused by meat, poultry, or eggs.\nCall FDA at 1-866-300-4374 for all other foods.\nCall your local health department if you think you got sick from food you ate in a restaurant or from another food seller.\n\nWho is at risk?\nAnyone can get sick from eating spoiled food. Some people are more likely to get sick from food illnesses.\n\nPregnant women\nOlder adults\nPeople with certain health conditions like cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and kidney disease\n\nSome foods are more risky for these people.

        "content": "What's New\nIn October 2021, FDA and EPA issued updated advice about eating fish that incorporates the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020-2025. Visit Advice about Eating Fish: For those who might become or are pregnant or breastfeeding and children ages 1 - 11 years to learn more.\n\nDownload the Booklet in English\nen español (Spanish)\nFood safety is vital for everyone – but especially for pregnant women, their unborn babies, and children younger than five. This booklet explains why and provides real-world advice on how to lower the risk of foodborne illness for pregnant women and their unborn babies, and how parents can protect their young children from foodborne infections.\nIn addition to the information in this booklet, talk with your health care provider about any foods or other products to avoid because of any special health needs for you or your child.\nFood Safety: Why It’s Critically Important for Pregnant Women, Their Unborn Babies, and Children Under Five\nWhen disease-causing bacteria, viruses, or parasites (germs) contaminate food, they can trigger foodborne illness, often called food poisoning. While the food supply in the United States is among the safest in the world, it can still be a source of infection.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 48 million persons — or 1 of every 6 people — get foodborne infections each year. Of those, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from their foodborne illness.\nPregnant women are at high risk of developing food poisoning because pregnancy affects their immune system’s ability to fight foodborne infections. The immune system is made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body against infectious organisms and other invaders.\nUnborn babies are just beginning to develop immune systems and have little power to resist foodborne disease.\nBecause of the immune system changes in women during pregnancy and the developing immune systems of unborn children, they are both especially at risk for illnesses caused by Listeria monocytogenes and Toxoplasma gondii. The infection caused by these two organisms can pass to an unborn child even if the mother doesn’t show signs of infection.\n\t\nListeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a harmful germ found in many foods, including ready-to-eat refrigerated foods like deli meats, unpasteurized (raw) milk, and such foods as soft cheeses made with unpasteurized milk. Lm can lead to a disease called listeriosis. Every year, 2,500 Americans become ill with listeriosis — 1 out of 5 cases result in death. About one-third of listeriosis cases happen during pregnancy. Listeriosis can cause miscarriage, premature delivery, stillbirth, and serious sickness or death for a newborn baby.\nToxoplasma gondii is a parasite found in many food sources, as well as cat litter boxes and other areas where cats may leave their waste. It can cause hearing loss, blindness, and brain damage in babies.\nOther organisms that can cause food poisoning, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. Coli, also may lead to health complications for pregnant women, unborn babies, and newborns.\n\n\nChildren younger than 5 years have a high risk of foodborne illness and related health problems because their immune systems are still developing, and they cannot fight off infections as well as older children and adults. Also, young children make less stomach acid that kills harmful bacteria, making it easier for them to get sick.\nBecause young children’s bodies are small, the vomiting and/or diarrhea often resulting from foodborne illness can lead to serious dehydration.\nIn children under 5 years, some foodborne infections with the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a severe complication that can cause chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, and death. E. coli infections are likely to come from undercooked ground meat, unpasteurized (“raw”) milk, unpasteurized fruit juice, lettuce, spinach, sprouts, and even frozen cookie dough, if eaten before it is cooked.\n\nDownload the Booklet in English\nen español (Spanish)"

        "content": "On this page:\n\nWhat is Stress Urinary Incontinence?\nWhat are the Treatment Options for Women with Stress Urinary Incontinence?\nWhat Questions Should I Ask My Surgeon If I am Considering Surgery to Treat Stress Urinary Incontinence?\nWhat Should I Do After My Surgery to Treat Stress Urinary Incontinence? \n\n\nWhat is Stress Urinary Incontinence?\nStress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a leakage of urine during moments of physical activity that increases abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise. SUI is the most common type of urinary incontinence in women.\nSUI can happen when pelvic tissues and muscles, which support the bladder and urethra, become weak and allow the bladder \"neck\" (where the bladder and urethra intersect) to descend during bursts of physical activity. This descent can prevent the urethra from working properly to control the flow of urine. SUI can also occur when the sphincter muscle that controls the urethra weakens. The weakened sphincter muscle is not able to stop the flow of urine under normal circumstances and when there is an increase in abdominal pressure. Weakness may occur from pregnancy, childbirth, aging, or prior pelvic surgery. Other risk factors for SUI include chronic coughing or straining, obesity and smoking.\nIt is important for you to consult with your health care provider for proper diagnosis of SUI.\n\nImage Source: National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse\nWhat are the Treatment Options for Women with Stress Urinary Incontinence?\nWomen have both non-surgical and surgical options to treat SUI.\nNot every woman with SUI will need surgery. Some factors you should consider before deciding whether to undergo surgery include:\n\nthe severity of your SUI symptoms and their effect on your daily activities;\nyour desire for future pregnancy as vaginal delivery can cause recurrence of SUI symptoms, which could require future surgery\n\nNONSURGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS\nExamples of nonsurgical treatment options for SUI include:\n\nPelvic Floor Exercises: A type of exercise to strengthen the pelvic floor by contracting and relaxing the muscles that surround the opening of the urethra, vagina, and rectum. These exercises, commonly referred to as Kegel exercises, improve the muscles’ strength and function and may help to hold urine in the bladder longer.\nPessary: A removable device that is inserted into the vagina against the vaginal wall and urethra to support the bladder neck. This helps reposition the urethra to reduce SUI.\nTransurethral Bulking Agents: Collagen injections around the urethra that make the space around the urethra thicker, thus helping to control urine leakage. The effects may not be permanent.\nBehavioral Modification: This includes avoiding activities that trigger episodes of leaking.\n\nSURGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS\nSurgery to decrease or prevent urine leakage can be done through the vagina or abdomen. The urethra or bladder neck is supported with either stitches alone or with tissue surgically removed from other parts of the body such as the abdominal wall or leg (fascial sling), with tissue from another person (donor tissue) or with material such as surgical mesh (mesh sling).\nSurgical mesh in the form of a \"sling\" (sometimes called \"tape\") is permanently implanted to support the urethra or bladder neck in order to correct SUI. This is commonly referred to as a \"sling procedure.\"\nThe use of surgical mesh slings to treat SUI provides a less invasive approach than non-mesh repairs, which require a larger incision in the abdominal wall. The multi-incision sling procedure can be performed using three incisions, in two ways: with one vaginal incision and two lower abdominal incisions, called retropubic; or with one vaginal incision and two groin/thigh incisions, called transobturator. There is also a \"mini-sling\" procedure that utilizes a shorter piece of surgical mesh, which may be done with only one incision.\n \nImage Source: National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse\nWhat Questions Should I Ask My Surgeon If I am Considering Surgery to Treat Stress Urinary Incontinence?\nAsk your surgeon about all SUI treatment options, including non-surgical options and surgical options that do and do not use mesh slings. It is important for you to understand why your surgeon may be recommending a particular treatment option to treat your SUI.\nAny surgery for SUI may put you at risk for complications, including additional surgery. One complication that may occur when mesh slings are used is vaginal mesh erosion, which could require additional surgery to resolve.\nIf mesh erosion occurs through the vaginal tissue, it is possible that men may experience penile irritation and/or pain during sexual intercourse.\nAsk your surgeon the following questions before you decide to have SUI surgery:\n\nWhat surgical or non-surgical treatment options are available and what do you recommend to treat my SUI?\nHave you had specialized training in the surgical treatment of SUI, and if so, what type of training have you had with this particular product and/or procedure?\nWhat can I expect after surgery and what is the recovery time?\nIf I also have pelvic organ prolapse, will that change how you treat my SUI?\nWhat if the surgery doesn’t correct my problem?\nWhich side effects should I report to you after the surgery?\nAre you planning to use a mesh sling in my surgery? If so:\n\t\nHow often have you performed this surgery using this particular product? What results have your other patients had with this product?\nWhat are the pros and cons of using a mesh sling in my particular case? How likely is it that my repair could be successfully performed without using a mesh sling?\nAre recovery times different for mesh sling surgery compared to non-mesh surgery?\nWill my partner be able to feel the mesh sling during sexual intercourse?\nIf I have a complication related to the mesh sling, how likely is it that the complication can be resolved? Will you treat it or will I be referred to a specialist experienced with mesh sling complications?\nIs there patient information that comes with the product, and can I have a copy?\n\n\n\nWhat Should I Do After My Surgery to Treat Stress Urinary Incontinence?\n\nContinue with annual check-ups and follow-up care, notifying your health care provider if complications develop, such as persistent vaginal bleeding or discharge, pelvic or groin pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. There is no need to take additional action if you are satisfied with your surgery and are not having complications or symptoms.\nIf you have complications or other symptoms:\n\t\nDiscuss complications and treatment options with your health care provider. Only your health care provider can give you personalized medical advice.\nConsider getting a second opinion from a surgeon who specializes in female pelvic reconstruction if you are not satisfied with your discussion with your health care provider.\n\n\nLet your health care provider know you have a mesh sling, especially if you plan to have another surgery, plan to become pregnant or have other medical procedures.\nIf you have had SUI surgery but do not know whether your surgeon used a mesh sling, ask your health care provider.\nTalk to your health care provider about any additional questions you may have.\nSubmit a voluntary report about any problems experienced with surgical mesh slings through Medwatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nAmerican Urogynecologic Society Information for Patients: Pelvic Floor Disorders\nAmerican Urogynecologic Society Information for Patients: Bladder Control"

        "topic": "6 Tip-offs to rip-offs: don't fall for health fraud scams",
        "content": "Español\nBogus product! Danger! Health fraud alert!\nYou’ll never see these warnings on health products, but that’s what you ought to be thinking when you see claims like “miracle cure,” “guaranteed results,” or “vaccine alternative.”\nHealth fraud scams have been around for hundreds of years and play on the desire for a quick or miracle cure. The snake-oil salesmen of old have morphed into the deceptive, high-tech marketers of today, preying on people’s desires for easy solutions to difficult health problems—including Alzheimer’s, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, memory loss, sexual performance, weight loss, and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), influenza and other infectious diseases.\nAccording to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a health product is fraudulent if it is deceptively promoted as being effective against a disease or health condition, but not scientifically proven safe and effective for that purpose.\nNot Worth the Risk\nScammers promote their products with savvy marketing, often using tactics that target specific populations via the web and email, but also by word-of-mouth, newspapers, magazines, TV, and direct mail. Health fraud scams run rampant on social media sites and closed messaging apps, such as Signal, Viber, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.\nHealth fraud scams can also be found in other locations such as convenience stores, gas stations, flea markets and nontraditional stores, targeting those with limited English proficiency and limited access to health care services and information. Other risks include potentially dangerous or unproven products ordered direct from overseas sources via mail to circumvent normal Customs and FDA inspections and other safety measures.\nConsumers can increase their chances of identifying and avoiding health fraud scams by focusing on being smart, aware and careful when purchasing health care products.\n\nTip-Offs\nHere are six tip-offs to help you identify rip-offs.\n\nOne product does it all. Be suspicious of products that claim to cure a wide range of diseases. The agency continues to send warning letters and take enforcement action as appropriate against companies marketing fake cure-all products. These miracle cures don’t exist - they’re bogus – and the only thing these companies are selling is false hope.\nPersonal \"success\" testimonials. Success stories, such as, “It cured my diabetes” or “It immediately stopped my COVID-19 infection,” are easy to make up and are not a substitute for scientific evidence. Reviews found on popular online marketplaces and social media can be fake.\nQuick fixes. Few diseases or conditions can be treated quickly, even with legitimate products. Beware of language such as, “Lose 30 pounds in 30 days,” “protects from viral infections,” or “eliminates skin cancer in days.”\n“All natural” cure or treatment. Don't be fooled by descriptions like \"all-natural cure.\" Such phrases are often used in health fraud as an attention-grabber to suggest that a product is safer than conventional treatments. These terms don't necessarily equate to safety. Some plants found in nature (such as poisonous mushrooms) can be harmful or even kill when consumed. Moreover, the FDA has found numerous products promoted as “all-natural” cures or treatments that contain hidden and dangerously high doses of prescription drug ingredients or other active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n“Miracle cure.” Alarms should go off when you see this claim or others like it such as, “new discovery,” “guaranteed results,” or “secret ingredient.” If a real cure for a serious disease were FDA-approved, it would be widely reported through the media and prescribed by licensed health professionals—not plastered on advertisements in social media and messaging apps, or buried in websites, print ads, and TV infomercials.\nConspiracy theories. Claims like “This is the cure our government or Big Pharma doesn’t want you to know about” are used to distract consumers from the obvious, common-sense questions about the so-called miracle cure.\n\n\nA Pervasive Problem\nFraudulent products not only can’t deliver on their baseless promises—they could cause serious injury, or even death. Besides wasting money and delaying potentially life-saving diagnosis and scientifically tested and proven treatments, fraudulent products sometimes contain hidden drug ingredients that can be harmful when unknowingly taken by consumers.\nFor example, in recent years, FDA laboratories have found hundreds of weight-loss products, illegally marketed as dietary supplements, that contained sibutramine, a Schedule IV controlled substance and the active ingredient in a prescription weight-loss drug. This prescription drug was later withdrawn from the U.S. market after studies showed that it was associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Furthermore, fraudulent products may be manufactured by unregistered facilities under unknown, unclean, or dangerous conditions.\nHealth fraud scams can involve a variety of FDA-regulated products. For example, the FDA found an expensive laser device being sold with fraudulent cure-all claims to treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and diabetes. Three individuals were sentenced to prison for their involvement in the $16.6 million fraudulent scheme to distribute misbranded devices.\nEven with these tips, fraudulent health products are not always easy to spot. If consumers are tempted to buy an unproven product or one with questionable claims, they should check with their doctor or other health care professional first.\nSubmitting Adverse Event Reports to the FDA\nConsumers experiencing adverse reactions to a product should submit voluntary adverse event reports to the FDA using:\n\nReport Online\nReporting Unlawful Sales of Medical Products on the Internet (English/Spanish)\nConsumer Reporting Form FDA 3500B. Follow the instructions on the form to either fax or mail it in for submission. For help filling out the form, see MedWatchLearn.\nCall FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 to report by telephone."

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nEvery patient should ask questions when getting a new prescription. This is especially important when your doctor, dentist or other health care professional prescribes you an opioid pain medicine, such as hydrocodone, oxycodone or morphine.\nOpioid medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can be used to treat certain kinds of acute and chronic pain. They also can have very serious side effects.\nWhat should you ask your health care professional?\n1. Why do I need this medication — is it right for me?\nThis conversation could begin with: “My condition is causing pain. How long can I expect the pain to last? What medication are you giving me?”\nIf it’s an opioid pain medicine, ask: “Are there non-opioid options that could help with pain relief while I recover?”\nIf your doctor thinks your pain is best managed with a prescription opioid, then ask:\n2. How long should I take this medication?\nFind out when, and how, to stop using opioid pain medicines. Ask your health care professional to prescribe the lowest dose possible for the shortest time needed and the smallest quantity you may need. Also, ask when you should follow up with your health care professional to discuss whether the medication is controlling your pain.\nWhat are the side effects of this medication?\nPrescription opioid pain medicines can be safe and effective when used correctly for a medical condition and under a health care professional’s supervision. But they can cause serious side effects if not used correctly. Medical use of these products in ways that are different from what was prescribed or use for nonmedical reasons can lead to dependence, addiction and even death.\nSome side effects of opioid pain medicines include dizziness, drowsiness, weakness, nausea and constipation. Learn to identify these side effects so you and your family will know when to call a doctor, go to the hospital or seek emergency medical help (such as calling 911).\nFor more information, ask your pharmacist if your prescription comes with a Medication Guide (paper handouts that come with many prescription medicines).\nHow can I reduce the risk of potential side effects from this medication?\nTake your medicine exactly as prescribed. If you are still feeling pain, call your health care professional; do not take an extra dose.\nWhat if I have a history of substance use disorder?\nTell your health care professional about any history you have had with substance use disorder involving drugs or alcohol. You should also tell them if anyone in your family has had a problem with substance use disorder involving drugs or alcohol.\nWhat about the other medications I’m taking?\nIt is very important that you tell your health care professional about other prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter, or OTC) medicines you are taking, especially those prescribed to you to treat anxiety, sleeping problems or seizure. Even remedies you take only occasionally could interact with the opioid pain medicine. Ask your health care professional or pharmacist about possible interactions.\nHow should I store my opioid pain medicine?\nIf you have children at home — from toddler through teenager — consider a lockbox for your medications. Even one accidental dose of an opioid pain medicine meant for an adult can cause a fatal overdose in a child.\nBe aware that other people, including teenagers and visitors, may seek out opioid pain medicines for nonmedical use in your home. They may look in your bathroom medicine cabinets searching for these medicines.\nWhat should I do with unused opioid pain medicine?\nDispose of unused medicines promptly. Your leftover opioids can be targeted by people who you’d never expect to take it: friends, relatives and even your children and their friends.\nIf there is no drug take-back program near you, the FDA has created a list of opioid pain medicines we recommend you flush down the toilet when they’re no longer needed. This way, you can avoid accidental exposures to opioid pain medicine in the home.\nAlso, check with your pharmacist. Some pharmacies have on-site medicine drop-off boxes, mail-back programs and other ways to help you safely dispose your unused medicines.\nCan I share this medication with someone else?\nNo. Your prescription is for you. Your health care professional considers many factors when prescribing opioids. What’s safe for you might cause serious side effects or even an overdose for someone else.\n3. Should I have naloxone on hand?\nTalk with your health care professional about naloxone, a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and save lives. The labeling for opioid pain medicines already recommends that patients at high risk of overdose should be prescribed naloxone along with the opioid. In many cases it makes sense to be prepared for potential problems by keeping naloxone in your home.\nSome naloxone products are safe and effective for nonprescription use; other drugs may require a prescription. Many states allow “standing orders,” which means that consumers can get naloxone directly from a pharmacist, without having a prescription. This allows access to naloxone to anyone who thinks they might need it, either for themselves or for someone else who might be at risk for an overdose.\nPlay it safe. Ask your health care professional these questions before taking opioid pain medicines."

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this page: Frequently asked questions | Pregnant and breastfeeding women | Search for a clinical trial | FDA’s role | Resources | Related links \nFrequently asked questions about women in clinical trials\n\nWhat are clinical trials?\nDo women participate in clinical trials?\nWhy should women participate in clinical trials?\nWhat is informed consent?\nWhat are some of the things to know before volunteering to join a clinical trial (clinical study)?\nHow do I find a specific clinical trial?\n\nWhat are clinical trials?\nClinical trials are a type of research study that test investigational medical products in human volunteers to see whether these products should be approved or cleared for wider use in the general population. A medical product could be a drug, medical device, or biological product, such as a vaccine, blood product, or gene therapy. \nClinical trials help bring new medical products to people who need them. There are many ways you can volunteer to take part in a trial. Some clinical trials enroll healthy people. Other trials enroll people who have a certain health problem. Read this page to help you talk with your health care provider about whether a clinical trial is right for you and how to find clinical trials near you.\nAre women in clinical trials?\nHistorically, women have not always been included in clinical trials. Over the years, efforts have been made to promote inclusion of women of all ages, women from all racial and ethnic groups, women with disabilities or chronic health conditions, as well as those who are pregnant, lactating or breastfeeding in clinical trials. Women who participate in clinical trials can help improve the health of all women.\nWhy should women participate in clinical trials?\nThere are important differences between men and women that can affect health, disease, and response to treatment. FDA looks for those differences. It is important that diverse women volunteer to participate in trials to help improve the generalizability of trial results across the population of patients who may use the medical product. By volunteering to join a trial, you can make a difference by helping health care providers and scientists learn more about how medical products affect women, and if the medical products are safe and work well in both men and women.\nWhat is informed consent?\nInformed consent is a process that involves providing a potential trial participant with enough information to make an informed decision about participating in the clinical trial. Informed consent includes helping potential participants understand what will happen during the trial if they agree to participate and provides them an opportunity to ask questions and consider whether to participate. The informed consent process involves providing additional information as the clinical trial progresses or as the participant or situation requires. It also includes the participant’s voluntary agreement to participate. To be effective, the process of informed consent must provide sufficient opportunity for the participant to ask questions and to consider whether to volunteer to participate.  \nWhat are some things to know before volunteering to join a clinical trial (clinical study)?\nThis is a list of questions that you can consider asking before you volunteer to join a clinical trial (study). It is not everything you need to know, but it can help you start the conversation. Make sure any questions you have about participating have been answered before you volunteer to join a trial. \nFind out:\nThe purpose of the trial and what will happen during the trial\n1. Why is this trial being done and how long will my participation in the trial last?\n2. What procedures (steps) will be followed?\n    a. Are any products used in the trial experimental? If so, can you tell me about them?\n3. What drugs, tests, or other medical products will I or might I receive?\n4. Can I take my current medicines?\n5. How often will I need to follow-up with the trial team at the clinic (or check-in virtually)?\n6. What will happen when the trial ends?\n    a. Will I still have access to the medical product being studied when the trial ends?\n    b. Will the researchers continue to check on my health?\n7. Will I get the results of the tests that are conducted on me during the trial and the results of the trial once it is done?\nThe possible benefits and foreseeable risks\nA trial may provide investigational medical products, but there is no promise that your health will be better. The medical product being studied may not work for you, but the trial may help other people.\n8. What are the risks (side effects) of participating in the clinical trial?\n    a. What risks are more likely to occur and what are the serious risks?  \n    b. Will I likely feel discomfort or pain?\n9. What are the potential benefits of the medical product being studied?\n    a. What are the potential benefits to me?\n    b. What are the potential benefits to others, such as future patients with my disease or medical condition?\nOther treatments or procedures\n10. What different treatments or options are available for people with my medical condition?\n    a. Can you tell me about other appropriate options, like medicines or surgery that might help me?\n    b. Can you describe the care I would likely receive if I chose not to join the trial?\nConfidentiality or privacy\n11. Will my trial records be kept confidential or private?\n    a. How will my personal information be protected? \n    b. Will my personal information be shared with anyone?\nFinancial and other support\n12. Will I be paid to participate in the clinical trial?\n13. Will I receive reimbursement for expenses I might incur as a result of participating in the trial and, if so, what will be reimbursed?\n14. What products or services will the trial provide or pay for?\n    a. What costs, if any, could I have to pay for?\n15. What products or financial support may I be given if injury occurs?\n    a. Where may I get more information?\nHow to get more information\n16. Whom should I contact if I have questions or problems?\n    a. If contact information changes during the trial, how will I get the new information?\nHow pregnant women can participate in research\nMany women may need to get a vaccine or take medication while they are pregnant or breastfeeding. They may need treatment for a health problem they had before becoming pregnant or one that started or got worse while pregnant or breastfeeding.\nSometimes, women who are pregnant may volunteer to join clinical trials for investigational medical products, including investigational vaccines. But, more often, pregnant women volunteer to join a pregnancy exposure registry. \nPregnancy exposure registries are studies that collect information about how medicines taken, or vaccines received during pregnancy, affect those who are pregnant and the developing fetus. Some registries also collect information about the infant for a period of time after birth. The information collected can help health care providers and others who are pregnant learn more about the safety of medicines and vaccines used during pregnancy.\nFor more information, see: Pregnancy Exposure Registries. Breastfeeding women can also volunteer to join a study, such as a lactation registry. Talk with your health care provider for more information. \nHow do I find a specific clinical trial?\nYou can go to clinicaltrials.gov to search for a clinical trial. You can search for clinical trials in your area. You can search for a clinical trial for a specific disease or health condition. \nSearch for a clinical trial \n\n\nEnter a word or phrase, such as the name of a medical condition or intervention.\nExample: Cancer AND Los Angeles\n  \n\n\nFDA’s role\nFDA works to make sure that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of medical products intended for human use.

Still others take medicines or get a vaccine before they find out they are pregnant.\nPregnancy exposure registries are research studies that collect information about the effect that prescription medicines taken or vaccines received during pregnancy may have on you and your developing fetus. These studies collect information from those who are pregnant and who are taking or have taken a certain medicine or received a certain vaccine while pregnant. Some pregnancy exposure registries collect information from those who are pregnant but have not taken a certain medicine or received a certain vaccine. Some pregnancy exposure registry studies also collect information about newborn babies for a period of time after birth.\nYou can volunteer to join a pregnancy exposure registry if one is open and enrolling. The information collected can help health care providers and others who are pregnant to learn more about the safety of medicines and vaccines used during pregnancy. Learn more about how you can help.\n\nDo you know what a Pregnancy Exposure Registry is?\n\nWatch this video to learn about Pregnancy Exposure Registries and how you can help health care providers learn more about the safety of medicines and vaccines used during pregnancy.\n\nLearn more: \n\nIf you are pregnant\nIf you are a health professional\nIf you want to find a registry\n\nRelated links\n\nMedicine and Pregnancy\nCOVID-19 Pregnancy Registries\nUS Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry\nTips for Pregnant Women\nPregnancy and Lactation Labeling"

Any contact lenses that are not prescribed by a doctor are illegal and could cause you harm.\nYou may want to have the perfect look for Halloween or look like your favorite movie star or singer, but choosing to change the look of your eyes with contact lenses could cause a lot of damage to your eyesight if you get them without the input of your eye care professional. Decorative contact lenses are sometimes called, among other names:\n\nHalloween contact lenses\nFashion contact lenses\nColored contact lenses\nCosmetic contact lenses\nTheatre contact lenses\n\nDecorative contact lenses change the look of your eyes. They may not correct your vision. They can temporarily change your brown eyes to blue or make your eyes look like cat eyes or vampire eyes for Halloween.\nDid you know that these decorative contact lenses are actually medical devices? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversees their safety and effectiveness, just like contact lenses that correct your vision.\nJust like corrective contact lenses, you should never buy contact lenses from a street vendor, beauty supply store, flea market, novelty store or Halloween store—and you should always have a prescription.\nHere's what you need to know before using contact lenses.\nKnow the Risks of Decorative and Halloween Contact Lenses\n\nPhoto of serious eye infection (pseudomonas)\noften associated with Halloween contact lenses\nand decorative contact lenses. Image courtesy\nof Thomas Steinemann, MD and MetroHealth\nMedical Center\nWearing decorative contact lenses can be risky.\nWearing any kind of contact lenses, including decorative ones, can cause serious damage to your eyes if the lenses are obtained without a prescription or not used correctly.\nThese risks include:\n\nA cut or scratch on the top layer of your eyeball (Corneal Abrasion)\nAllergic reactions like itchy, watery red eyes\nDecreased vision\nInfection\nBlindness\n\nWhen wearing any type of contact lenses, be aware of signs of possible eye infection, which include:\n\nRedness\nPain in the eye(s) that doesn't go away after a short period of time\nDecreased vision\n\nIf you have any of these signs, you need to see a licensed eye doctor (optometrist or ophthalmologist) right away! An eye infection could become serious and cause you to become blind if it is not treated.\nBe sure to follow the directions for cleaning, disinfecting, and wearing the lenses that your doctor gives you. If your doctor doesn't give you any directions — ask for them!\nDo's and Don'ts of Decorative and Halloween Lenses\nDo get an eye exam! A licensed eye doctor will examine your eyes to make sure the contact lenses fit properly. The fit of your contact lenses is very important. A wrong fit can cause damage to your eyes. Be sure to always go for follow-up eye exams as instructed by your doctor.\nDo get a prescription! All contact lenses should be prescribed by a doctor, including decorative lenses. The prescription should include the brand name, correct lens measurements and expiration date.\nDo follow the contact lens care instructions! Follow the instructions for wearing, cleaning and disinfecting your contact lenses that come with your contact lenses. If you do not receive instructions, ask an eye doctor for them.\nDo seek medical attention right away and remove your contact lenses if your eyes are red, have ongoing pain or discharge! Redness, pain and discharge from the eyes are signs of an eye infection. If you think you have an eye infection from your contact lenses, remove them and see an eye doctor right away.\nDon't share your contact lenses with anyone else!You wouldn't share your toothbrush, would you? All eyes are not the same size and shape and your contact lenses are fitted just for you.\nDon't buy any contact lenses without a prescription! If you don't see an eye doctor and get a prescription, then the contact lenses you get may not fit properly and may not work well. They could even damage your eyes. Sometimes wearing contact lenses can damage the top layer of your eyeball (cornea). Even if you aren't having any problems now, the lenses still could be causing damage to your eyes. By having regular checkups and buying contact lenses with a prescription, you will reduce the chances of any undetected damage to your eyes.\nBuying Decorative or Halloween Contact Lenses\nYou can buy contact lenses, including decorative contact lenses, from your eye doctor, on the Internet, or from a mail-order company, which includes foreign manufacturers/distributors of decorative lenses. It's very important that you only buy contact lenses from a company that sells FDA-cleared or approved contact lenses and requires you to provide a prescription.\nAnyone selling you contact lenses must get your prescription and verify it with your doctor. They should request not only the prescription, but the name of your doctor and their phone number. If they don't ask for this information they are breaking federal law and could be selling you illegal contact lenses.\nRemember — Buying contact lenses without a prescription is dangerous!\nNever buy contact lenses from a street vendor, a beauty supply store, flea market, novelty store or Halloween store, or from unknown online distributors as they may be contaminated and/or counterfeit and therefore not safe to use.\nEven though there are a lot of products that you can buy without a prescription, contact lenses are not one of them. It's your job to make sure you protect your eyes by having an eye exam, getting a prescription, and buying contact lenses from a legal source.\nReporting a Problem\nYou can report:\n\nAdverse events including contact lens related infections or potentially counterfeit products\n\t\nFDA Medwatch\n\n\nUnlawful internet sales or contact lens vendors selling without a prescription\n\t\nReport a Problem Web Form\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) Complaint Assistant\n\n\nEmails promoting medical products that might be illegal\n\t\nFDA Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) Web complaints\n\n\nAllegations that a medical device manufacturer or its product is in violation of the law\n\t\nAllegations of Regulatory Misconduct Web Form\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\nFor more information about decorative contact lenses, go to:\n\nHalloween Safety Tips: Costumes, Candy, and Colored Contact Lenses\nInfographic: Don't Lose Sight of Your Vision (PDF - 276KB)\nDecorative Contact Lenses\n\"Colored\" and Decorative Contact Lenses: A Prescription Is A Must\nBuying Contact Lenses Without a Prescription is Dangerous!

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nWouldn't it be cool to have vampire eyes for Halloween? Or deep violet eyes to match your purple sweater? How about your favorite sports team logo on your eyes just for fun?\nYou can have all of these looks with decorative contact lenses (sometimes called fashion, costume, or colored contact lenses). Some of these lenses may not correct vision — they just change how your eyes look.\nBut you need a prescription to avoid eye injury. Before buying decorative lenses, here’s what to know.\nDecorative contact lenses are not cosmetics or over-the-counter merchandise. They are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Places that advertise them as cosmetics or sell them over-the-counter, without a prescription, are breaking the law.\nDecorative contact lenses are not “one size fits all.” An eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist) must measure each eye to properly fit the lenses and evaluate how your eye responds to contact lens wear. A poor fit can cause serious eye damage, including:\n\nscratches on the cornea (the clear dome of tissue over the iris — the part of the eye that gives you your eye color)\ncorneal infection (an ulcer or sore on the cornea)\nconjunctivitis (pink eye)\ndecreased vision\nblindness\n\nPlaces that sell decorative lenses without a prescription may give you few or no instructions on how to clean and care for your lenses. Failure to use the proper solution to keep contact lenses clean and moist can lead to infections. Bacterial infections can be extremely rapid, result in corneal ulcers, and cause blindness — sometimes within as little as 24 hours if not diagnosed and treated promptly.\nWhere NOT to Buy Contact Lenses\nThe FDA is aware that many places illegally sell decorative contact lenses to consumers without valid prescriptions for as little as $20.\nNever buy lenses from:\n\nstreet vendors\nsalons or beauty supply stores\nboutiques\nflea markets\nnovelty stores\nHalloween stores\nrecord or video stores\nconvenience stores\nbeach shops\nInternet sites that do not require a prescription\n\nThese are not authorized distributors of contact lenses, which are prescription devices by federal law. In addition, some of these contact lenses may be counterfeit devices or may not have been cleared or approved by the FDA. You can talk with your eye care provider if you have questions. And if you find a website you think is illegally selling contact lenses over the web, you should report it to FDA.\nHow to Safely Wear Decorative or Colored Contact Lenses\nGet an eye exam from a licensed eye doctor (ophthalmologist or optometrist), even if you feel your vision is perfect.\nGet a valid prescription that includes the brand name, lens measurements, and an expiration date.\nBuy the lenses from a seller that requires you to provide a prescription, whether you purchase them in person or shop online.\nFollow all directions for cleaning, disinfecting, and wearing the lenses, and visit your eye doctor for follow-up eye exams. It‘s especially important to read and follow all instructions because you can injure your eyes if you do not use these medical device products according to the labeling. (See additional information about cleaning solutions with hydrogen peroxide on the FDA website.)\nSee your eye doctor right away if you have signs of possible eye infection:\n\nredness\neye pain that doesn’t go away after a short time\ndecrease in vision"

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nThese days, eyeglasses can look pretty cool. Still, the day may come when your child asks you for contact lenses.\nThere are pros to consider — and cons.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates contact lenses and certain contact lens care products as medical devices. Contact lenses have benefits. They can be better for sports activities, because they don’t break as frames and the lenses of glasses can. In some cases, contact lenses improve the quality of vision in comparison to eyeglasses, especially for a child who is very nearsighted. \nContact lenses should be used safely, responsibly, and only under the supervision of your eye care professional. Otherwise, serious injury to the eye can result, particularly if the contact lenses are not removed at the first hint of a problem.\nContact Lens Risks and Safety Tips\nKids and contact lenses are not always the best fit.\nIf you are thinking about contacts for your child, you may want to look at how well your child handles other responsibilities, especially personal hygiene. Common behaviors that can result in injury include wearing another child’s lens; using saliva to moisten a lens; not following the directions of an eye care professional; and wearing cosmetic or decorative lenses purchased without a valid prescription from flea markets, beauty supply stores, the internet and other sources. \nIn fact, according to study published in Pediatrics, about 13,500 (or one-fourth) of the roughly more than 70,000 children who go to the emergency room each year for injuries and complications from medical devices are related to contact lenses. The problems from contact lenses include infections and eye abrasions — meaning that your eye can be bruised from contact lenses.\nThe most serious risk is that of ulcers (severe infections) of the cornea — which is the clear front part of the eye that shields it from germs, dust, and other harmful material. Ulcers are rare, but if not quickly treated and controlled, can result in permanent loss of vision. Not taking the necessary safety precautions can greatly increase the risk of ulcers. Eye care professionals generally do not recommend extended wear lenses (lenses that can be worn overnight or during sleep) for kids and teens because they can increase the incidence of corneal ulcers.\nDaily disposable lenses can reduce some of the risks associated with wearing lenses since a new pair is used each day.\nAnother point to consider: children with seasonal allergies are usually not good candidates for wearing contacts. The lenses may only increase the itching and burning caused by their allergies.\n\nContact Lens Safety Tips\n\nWash your hands before cleaning or inserting lenses. Carefully dry your hands with a clean, lint-free cloth.\nRub, rinse, clean and disinfect your contact lenses as directed. Only use the products and solutions recommended by your eye care professional. Note that cleaning and rinsing (and the use of most care solutions) is eliminated if daily disposable lenses are prescribed. \nNever expose your contact lenses to any kind of water or saliva.\nDo not wear your lenses for longer than prescribed. Do not sleep in lenses unless they are prescribed to be used that way.\nNever wear someone else’s lenses.\nAlways have a prescription for any lenses you wear.\nWhen playing sports, wear safety goggles or glasses over your lenses.\nApply any cosmetics after inserting lenses.  Remove your lenses before removing makeup.\nIn general, have a pair of back-up glasses handy.\nNever put a contact lens into an eye that is red.\nIf your eye is itching, burning, irritated or red, remove your lenses and contact your eye care professional.\n\n\nWhat Else Should You Know?\nMost contact lenses used by children are not used during sleep. And most lenses are used as a substitute for glasses, to provide only optical correction for blurry vision. However, there are some special types of contact lenses that may provide other benefits, or that may raise additional concerns. For example:\n\nThe FDA approved the first contact lens to slow the progression of nearsightedness in children. Kids would begin wearing the lenses between the ages of 8 and 12 years old. (These lenses are “daily disposable” lenses that are worn only during waking hours and disposed of every evening.) \nSome lenses can be worn during sleep. These lenses, which can be either soft or rigid, have substantially greater risk of severe eye infection that can result in vision loss. There is a type of rigid lens (orthokeratology lens) that is worn during sleep that is intended to slightly remold the cornea to temporarily reduce nearsightedness. These lenses are typically worn every night during sleep but are removed in the morning and let the nearsighted patient temporarily see more clearly without glasses or contact lenses. There are some increased risks with this type of rigid contact lens wear.\nDecorative contact lenses can give the eye a different cosmetic appearance and can be made with or without vision correction. Lenses without corrective power are still medical devices, require a prescription from your doctor, and have the same risks as other lenses do. These risks may be increased if the contact lenses are purchased online.\n\nIf your child is injured while wearing contact lenses, seek medical advice. Consumers and health care professionals are encouraged to report adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program."

        "content": "Print & Share (PDF)\nLa gente usa cosméticos para realzar su belleza. Estos productos incluyen desde pintura de labios y base para la cara, hasta desodorante, pasta dental y aerosol para el cabello.\n\nEn 1938, el Congreso aprobó la Ley sobre Alimentos, Medicamentos y Cosméticos (U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act). A lo largo de los setenta años de vigencia de la Ley, el Gobierno Federal ha trabajado con la industria para lograr que los cosméticos sean inocuos. Juntos, hemos hecho muchos cambios para proteger a los consumidores. A continuación, figuran algunas cosas importantes que hay que saber.\n¿En qué forma lo protege la ley?\nCosméticos:\n\nDeben fabricarse y envasarse en plantas limpias.\nNo pueden contener ingredientes tóxicos, en mal estado, ni dañinos para la salud.\nSólo pueden contener colorantes que estén aprobados por la FDA.\nDeben tener etiquetas claras y con información fidedigna.\n\n¡Lea la etiqueta!\nLa ley establece que la etiqueta debe incluir lo siguiente:\n\nDescripción del producto.\nUna lista de los ingredientes y las instrucciones para usarlo sin peligro para la salud.\nLa cantidad de producto que contiene el envase, expresada en peso.\nEl nombre de la empresa que fabrica o vende el producto.\n\n¿Hace la FDA pruebas de los cosméticos antes de que salgan al mercado?\nLa FDA no somete a prueba los cosméticos antes de que sean puestos a la venta. Antes de vender los cosméticos, las empresas fabricantes deben asegurarse de que tanto los productos como los ingredientes sean inocuos. Si esas empresas no acatan la ley, la FDA puede entablar acciones legales contra ellas.\nConsejos de belleza\n\nSiga las instrucciones de la etiqueta, en especial, las “Precauciones” y las “Advertencias.”\nMantenga los envases de los cosméticos limpios y bien cerrados cuando no está usándolos.\nLávese las manos antes de ponerse el maquillaje.\nNo comparta el maquillaje con nadie.\nNo agregue saliva ni agua al maquillaje.\nDeseche el maquillaje si ha cambiado de color o de olor.\nNo guarde el maquillaje en lugares donde la temperatura sea mayor de 85 grados Fahrenheit/29 grados Celsius.\nDeje de usar el producto si tiene una erupción u otro problema.\nNo use aerosoles mientras fuma o está cerca de alguna llama. Podría ocasionar un incendio.\nNo se maquille mientras está conduciendo.\n\nConsejos especiales para sus ojos\n\nNo guarde el rímel demasiado tiempo, algunas empresas recomiendan reemplazarlo cada tres meses.\nNo use maquillaje si tiene una infección en los ojos. En caso de tenerla eche a la basura el maquillaje para los ojos que estaba usando cuando contrajo la infección.\nNo aplique cosméticos cerca de los ojos, a menos que sean especiales para los ojos. Por ejemplo, no use un delineador de labios para los ojos. Podría llevar gérmenes de la boca a los ojos.\n\n¿Tienen los cosméticos fecha de vencimiento?\n\nNinguna ley obliga a que los cosméticos tengan fecha de vencimiento.\nLas fechas de vencimiento sólo son indicativas. Un producto puede alterarse si no se guarda de la manera adecuada.\n\n¿Presentan algún tipo de riesgo los probadores que se encuentran en los mostradores de productos de maquillaje?\n\nLos probadores pueden transmitir gérmenes porque los usa mucha gente.\nCuando pruebe un producto en el mostrador utilice una esponja o un hisopo nuevos.\n\n¿Puedo ser alérgico a los ingredientes de los cosméticos?\n\nAlgunas personas pueden reaccionar a ciertos componentes de los cosméticos. Por ejemplo, pueden tener picazón, irritación, erupción, estornudos o sibilancia.\nLas alergias pueden ocurrir la primera vez que usa el producto o después de usarlo varias veces.\n\n¿Qué debo hacer si tengo una reacción adversa a un cosmético?\n\nDeje de usar el producto.\nLlame al médico para saber lo que debe hacer.\nComuníquese con el Centro para la Seguridad Alimentaria y la Nutrición Aplicada (CFSAN) de la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA) por el teléfono (301) 436-2405 o\nEnvíe un e-mail a CAERS@cfsan.fda.gov.\nLlame a la empresa que fabrica el producto\n\nPara obtener más información:\nSi quiere leer acerca de los ingredientes de los cosméticos, visite: http://cosmeticsinfo.org/\nOficina de Salud de la Mujer (OWH) de la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA)\nCentro para la Seguridad Alimentaria y la Nutrición Aplicada de la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA)\nTeléfono: 1-888-723-3366\nResources For You\n\nCollege Women's Health\nTatuajes y Maquillaje Permanente [Tattoos and Permanent Makeup]\nTintes y cremas alisadoras para el cabello [Hair Dye and Relaxers]\nGet Other FDA Publications for Women\nFor Women Homepage"

        "topic": "Fragrances in Cosmetics",
        "content": "Many products we use every day contain fragrances. Some of these products are regulated as cosmetics by FDA. Some belong to other product categories and are regulated differently, depending on how the product is intended to be used. Here is information about fragrances that people often ask about:\n\nHow to Know If a Fragrance Product Is Regulated as a Cosmetic\n“Essential Oils” and “Aromatherapy”\nSafety Requirements\nLabeling of Fragrance Ingredients\nPhthalates as Fragrance Ingredients\n\n\nHow to Know If a Fragrance Product Is Regulated as a Cosmetic\nIf a product is intended to be applied to a person’s body to make the person more attractive, it’s a cosmetic under the law. Here are some examples of fragrance products that are regulated as cosmetics: \n\nPerfume\nCologne\nAftershave \n\nFragrance ingredients are also commonly used in other products, such as shampoos, shower gels, shaving creams, and body lotions. Even some products labeled “unscented” may contain fragrance ingredients. This is because the manufacturer may add just enough fragrance to mask the unpleasant smell of other ingredients, without giving the product a noticeable scent. \nSome fragrance products that are applied to the body are intended for therapeutic uses, such as treating or preventing disease, or affecting the structure or function of the body. Products intended for this type of use are treated as drugs under the law, or sometimes as both cosmetics and drugs. Here are some examples of labeling statements that will cause a product containing fragrances to be treated as a drug:\n\nEasing muscle aches\nSoothing headaches\nHelping people sleep\nTreating colic \n\nMany other products that may contain fragrance ingredients, but are not applied to the body, are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Here are some examples: \n\nLaundry detergents\nFabric softeners\nDryer sheets\nRoom fresheners\nCarpet fresheners  \n\nStatements on labels, marketing claims, consumer expectations, and even some ingredients may determine a product’s intended use. To learn more about the differences, including the different requirements, see \"Is it a Cosmetic, a Drug, or Both? (or Is It a Soap).\" \n“Essential Oils” and “Aromatherapy”\nThere is no regulatory definition for “essential oils,” although people commonly use the term to refer to certain oils extracted from plants. The law treats Ingredients from plants the same as those from any other source. \nFor example, “essential oils” are commonly used in so-called “aromatherapy” products. If an “aromatherapy” product is intended to treat or prevent disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body, it’s a drug. To learn more, see “Aromatherapy.”\nSimilarly, a massage oil intended to lubricate the skin is a cosmetic. But if claims are made that a massage oil relieves aches or relaxes muscles, apart from the action of the massage itself, it’s a drug, or possibly both a cosmetic and a drug. \nSafety Requirements\nFragrance ingredients in cosmetics must meet the same requirement for safety as other cosmetic ingredients. The law does not require FDA approval before they go on the market, but they must be safe for consumers when they are used according to labeled directions, or as people customarily use them. Companies and individuals who manufacture or market cosmetics have a legal responsibility for ensuring that their products are safe and properly labeled. To learn more, see “FDA Authority Over Cosmetics.” \nLabeling of Fragrance Ingredients\nIf a cosmetic is marketed on a retail basis to consumers, such as in stores, on the Internet, or person-to-person, it must have a list of ingredients. In most cases, each ingredient must be listed individually. But under U.S. regulations, fragrance and flavor ingredients can be listed simply as “Fragrance” or “Flavor.”\nHere’s why: FDA requires the list of ingredients under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA). This law is not allowed to be used to force a company to tell “trade secrets.” Fragrance and flavor formulas are complex mixtures of many different natural and synthetic chemical ingredients, and they are the kinds of cosmetic components that are most likely to be “trade secrets.” To learn more, see the regulation on cosmetic ingredient labeling and the Federal Register notice for this regulation, which addresses “trade secrets” and the FPLA.\nFragrance Allergies and Sensitivities\nSome individuals may be allergic or sensitive to certain ingredients in cosmetics, food, or other products, even if those ingredients are safe for most people. Some components of fragrance formulas may have a potential to cause allergic reactions or sensitivities for some people. \nFDA does not have the same legal authority to require allergen labeling for cosmetics as for food.  So, if you are concerned about fragrance sensitivities, you may want to choose products that are fragrance free, and check the ingredient list carefully. If consumers have questions, they may choose to contact the manufacturer directly. \nPhthalates as Fragrance Ingredients\nPhthalates are a group of chemicals used in hundreds of products. The phthalate commonly used in fragrance products is diethyl phthalate, or DEP. DEP does not pose known risks for human health as it is currently used in cosmetics and fragrances. To learn more, see “Phthalates and Cosmetic Products.”\nResources For You\n\nHow to Report a Problem\nLabeling Regulations\n\"Cosmeceutical\"\n\"Hypoallergenic\" Cosmetics\n\"Organic\" Cosmetics\nAromatherapy\nSoaps & Lotions\nFollow FDA Cosmetics on Twitter"

MoCRA amends Chapter VI of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and provides for the most significant expansion of FDA authority to regulate cosmetics since 1938.\nMoCRA requires a responsible person (see definition below) to report serious adverse events (see definition below) associated with the use of cosmetic products in the United States to FDA, within 15 business days. The responsible person must include a copy of the label on or within the retail packaging of such cosmetic product. If the responsible person receives medical or other information about the adverse event within 1 year of the initial report to FDA, they must submit this new information to FDA within 15 business days. FDA will also have access to adverse event reports during an inspection.\nIt is mandatory for industry responsible persons to submit serious adverse event reports (SAER) for cosmetic products by using the current Form FDA 3500A - Mandatory Reporting that is downloadable and fillable at MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program - Mandatory (PDF). \nPlease see the Instructions for Completing Form FDA 3500A.\nSubmit: \n\nthe completed Form 3500A and\na combined PDF file as one attachment that includes all relevant information to support the adverse event report, such as scans of labels and images of the adverse event \n\nto FDA via email at: CosmeticAERS@fda.hhs.gov or by mail to:\nFDA CDER Mail Center\nAttn: Cosmetics MedWatch reports\nWhite Oak Campus, Building 22, G0207\n10903 New Hampshire Ave.\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nFDA is developing a process for submitting electronic mandatory adverse event reports for cosmetic products. \nWhile MoCRA does not require industry responsible persons to submit non-serious adverse event reports for cosmetic products to FDA, you may submit non-serious adverse event reports voluntarily using Form 3500A, following the same process described above for mandatory adverse event reports.   \nKey Terms\nSerious Adverse Event: an adverse event that:\n(A) results in:\n\ndeath;\na life-threatening experience;\ninpatient hospitalization;\na persistent or significant disability or incapacity;\na congenital anomaly or birth defect;\nan infection; or\nsignificant disfigurement (including serious and persistent rashes, second- or third-degree burns, significant hair loss, or persistent or significant alteration of appearance), other than as intended under conditions of use that are customary or usual; or\n\n(B) requires, based on reasonable medical judgment, a medical or surgical intervention to prevent an outcome described in (A) above.\nResponsible Person: the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of a cosmetic product whose name appears on the label of such cosmetic product in accordance with section 609(a) of the FD&C Act or section 4(a) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act."

Both hair dye and hair relaxers can hurt your skin, hair, and eyes, especially if you are not careful. Some of these problems can be prevented. Get the facts before using hair dyes and hair relaxers.\n\n\nTips to Keep You Safe \n\n\nHow to Report Problems \n\n\n\nTips to Keep You Safe\n\n\nFollow all directions in the package.\n\n\nDo a patch test on your skin before using dye on your hair. Rub a small amount of dye on your skin. Let it dry for 48 hours. If you get a rash, do not use the dye on your hair.\n\n\n\n\nWear gloves when applying hair dye or relaxers.\n\n\nDo not dye your eyebrows or eyelashes at home. This can hurt your eyes and cause permanent discoloration. You might even go blind. The FDA has provided for the safe use of silver nitrate as a color additive, in professional-use only cosmetics, to color eyebrows and eyelashes. Use is restricted to up to 4 percent silver nitrate (by weight) in a viscous gel product. These silver nitrate containing cosmetic products are not intended for use on persons under the age of 16 or for application for longer than 1 minute. Furthermore, these products are not for distribution or direct sale to consumers.  \n\n\nDo not leave the product on longer than the directions say you should.\n\n\nRinse your scalp well with water after using hair dye or relaxers.\n\n\nKeep hair dyes and relaxers out the reach of children.  \n\n\n\n\nFormaldehyde in Hair Smoothing Products: What You Should Know\nMost hair smoothing or straightening products release formaldehyde gas into the air during the hair straightening or smoothing process. Formaldehyde gas is a known human carcinogen as classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and formaldehyde exposure can cause both short- and long-term health effects. Learn more about the steps you can take to be safer if you are considering using hair smoothing products here.\n\n\nReport Problems\nMost hair dyes do not need to be tested or approved by FDA before they are sold. FDA does monitor the safety of hair dyes and relaxers. Tell FDA if you have itchy or raw skin, scabs, hair loss or other problems after using these products.\nIf you have a bad reaction to hair dyes and relaxers, you should:\n\n\nStop using the product.\n\n\nCall your healthcare provider to find out how to take care of the problem.\n\n\nReport problems to FDA at: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm  or 1-800-332-1088.\n\n\nLearn More\n\nTypes of Hair Dyes\nBrazilian Blowout\nInformation for Salon Professionals\n\nResources For You\n\nHair Products\nCosmetics Tips\nCollege Women's Health\nGet Other FDA Publications for Women\nFor Women Homepage"

You are not alone. There are about 6 million pregnancies in the U.S. each year, and 80% of those who are pregnant say that they take at least one medicine. Some may be getting treatment for a health problem they had before pregnancy, while others take medicines for health problems, like diabetes, morning sickness, or high blood pressure, that can start or get worse during pregnancy. Still others take medicines or get a vaccine before they find out they are pregnant.\nPregnancy exposure registries are research studies that collect information about the effect that prescription medicines taken or vaccines received during pregnancy may have on you and your developing fetus. These studies collect information from those who are pregnant and who are taking or have taken a certain medicine or received a certain vaccine while pregnant. Some pregnancy exposure registries collect information from those who are pregnant but have not taken a certain medicine or received a certain vaccine. Some pregnancy exposure registry studies also collect information about newborn babies for a period of time after birth.\nYou can volunteer to join a pregnancy exposure registry if one is open and enrolling. The information collected can help health care providers and others who are pregnant to learn more about the safety of medicines and vaccines used during pregnancy. Learn more about how you can help.\n\nDo you know what a Pregnancy Exposure Registry is?\n\nWatch this video to learn about Pregnancy Exposure Registries and how you can help health care providers learn more about the safety of medicines and vaccines used during pregnancy.\n\nLearn more: \n\nIf you are pregnant\nIf you are a health professional\nIf you want to find a registry\n\nRelated links\n\nMedicine and Pregnancy\nCOVID-19 Pregnancy Registries\nUS Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry\nTips for Pregnant Women\nPregnancy and Lactation Labeling"

They help you track your blood sugar level at different times of the day and night.\n\nMeters can help you know how well your diabetes medicines are working. They can also help teach you how the food you eat and exercise can change your blood sugar level.\nThree things you will need with your meter:\n\nLancet - A small needle used to get a drop of blood from your finger or other part of your body.\nTest Strip - The strip goes into the meter. You put a drop of blood on the strip.\nControl Solution - Liquid used to make sure your meter is working right.\n\nMeters come in different sizes. Meters also come with different features. Some meters let you track and print out your test results. Others have audio and larger screens to help people who have problems seeing. The meter you choose should fit your lifestyle and your needs.\n\n7 Helpful Tips for Testing Your Blood Sugar and Caring for Your Meter\n\n\nRead the directions for your meter and test strips before you use them.\n\n\nWash your hands before you check your blood sugar. Food or juice on your fingers could make the meter give you the wrong  result.\n\n\nUse the right test strip for your meter. The meter may not work right or may give you the wrong result if you use the wrong test strip.\n\n\nWrite down your results and the date and time you tested. Do this even if your meter tracks your numbers. Take the results with you when you go to your doctor.\n\n\nClean your meter as directed. Some cleaning products may harm your meter.\n\n\nAsk your healthcare provider if your medicines will change your blood sugar. If you are a kidney patient on dialysis, the dialysis solution can change your blood sugar.\n\n\nTake your meter with you when you go to your doctor. This way you can test your blood sugar in front of the doctor or nurse to make sure you are doing it the right way. Your health care provider may be able to print out your blood sugar results from your meter.\n\n\nBonus Tip: Report serious problems with your meter. FDA monitors the safety and accuracy of glucose meters.

        "content": "This section will provide you with information on how to report problems you may encounter when using your glucose meter or your continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS).\nIf you would like to notify the FDA directly about a problem with a glucose meter or a CGMS, contact us using the information at the bottom of this page. In your e-mail, please include as much of the following information as possible:\n\nbrand of the meter or GGMS involved (and the model or catalog number, if known)\nlot number of the test strip or sensor involved\ndate of the event\nwhether you are the patient or family member or a health care provider\nwhether or not the manufacturer was notified about the problem\nthe patient's age\ndescription of patient’s symptoms at the time of the event\ndescription of the event, such as:\n\t\ninitial meter or CGMS test result\nIf the test was repeated, provide the test result(s) and indicate how long after the initial test the repeat testing was performed (e.g., 10 minutes later).\nIndicate whether the same testing device was used for repeat testing or if a different glucose testing device was used. If different, provide any information that is known about the 2nd testing device. Be sure to specify if any of testing was performed by a health care facility.\n\n\n\nOnce a glucose meter or a CGMS goes into widespread use, unforeseen problems may arise because the FDA's clearance and approval processes cannot always detect adverse events that are rare or related to the clinical use of the device or the users’ techniques and skills. The FDA also cannot always detect manufacturing problems or problems with the product labeling (including instructions for use) until after the device is on the market.\nTo identify these problems, the FDA and manufacturers depend on reports from the individuals who use glucose meters or CGMSs.\nWhat types of problems should be reported?\nDevice problems including:\n\nreagent or instrument failure/defective devices\ndefects in product design\nproduct instability\nany other device problems that compromise patient health or safety\nfailure to perform according to performance characterized in package insert\nincorrect test results (falsely elevated or decreased glucose results) that cause or contributed to an incorrect patient diagnosis and/or treatment\nunexplained quality control (QC) failures, contamination or stability problems with the quality control solutions or test strips\n\"near misses\" where under slightly different circumstances, a serious injury or death might have occurred, or use error\n\nUse-related problems including:\n\ninadequate and/or misleading labeling or confusing user instructions\nproduct confusion caused by name, labeling, design, or packaging\ninadequate packaging or poor package design\nany other user problems that compromise patient health or safety\n\nWho should report problems with glucose meters and CGMSs?\n\nUser facilities, including hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, nursing homes, outpatient treatment facilities, or outpatient diagnostic facilities are required to report:\n\t\ndevice-related events that have caused, or may have caused or contributed to a death to both the FDA and the manufacturer\ndevice-related events that have caused, or may have caused or contributed to a serious illness or injury to the manufacturer. If the medical device manufacturer is unknown, the serious injury is reported by the facility to the FDA.\n\n\nAll other glucose meter and CGMS users, including doctors and patients, are encouraged to voluntarily report device problems directly to the manufacturer and/or the FDA whenever it is suspected that the product caused or contributed to an adverse outcome.\n\nWhat happens to your report?\nWhen the FDA receives a report from a user facility, device user or an individual health care provider, it is entered in the medical device postmarket surveillance database. The FDA continually reviews the database to detect problems, trends, and potential hazards. When the FDA detects risks or potential risks associated with the use of a particular product, the agency can take corrective actions and notify the public.\nWho has access to your report?\nThe FDA is aware that glucose meter and CGMS users are concerned about the issue of confidentiality and public availability of reports. For all reports, the FDA holds the patient's identity in strict confidence and protects it to the fullest extent of the law. The FDA will not release any patient identifiers to the public. Reporters can assist in this process by not using the patient's name, initials, or other identifying information. The reporter's identity, including the identity of a self-reporter, may be shared with the manufacturer unless requested otherwise (there is a check-off box on the report form). However, the FDA will not disclose the reporter's identity in response to a request from the public, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.\nHow do you Report a Problem?\nProblems can be reported through the MedWatch Online Voluntary Reporting Form"

They must take insulin every day to stay alive.\nType 2 Diabetes\nPeople with type 2 diabetes do not make enough insulin or do not use it well enough. Some people with type 2 diabetes can use pills or other medicines that are injected into the body. Other people with type 2 also need insulin to help control their diabetes.\nGestational Diabetes\nSome women develop diabetes for the first time when they become pregnant. This is called gestational (jes-Tay-shun-ul) diabetes. Some women with gestational diabetes need to use insulin to control their blood sugar.\nHow often should I inject my insulin?\nEach person is different. Some people need to inject insulin one time each day. Others need to inject insulin more often. Many things affect how much insulin you need each day:\n\nType of Insulin You Use\nWhat You Eat\nYour Activity Level\nYour Other Health Conditions\n\nYour doctor will tell you how often you should inject your insulin.\nBack to Top\n\nTypes of Insulin\nThere are many different types of insulin. The type lets you know how fast the insulin starts working or how long it lasts in your body. Your health care provider will help you find the insulin that is best for you.\n\nRapid-Acting - This insulin starts working within 15 minutes after you use it. It is mostly gone out of your body after a few hours. It should be taken just before or just after you eat.\nShort-Acting - This insulin starts working within 30 minutes to 1 hour after you use it. It is mostly gone out of your body after a few hours. It should be taken 30-45 minutes before you eat.\nIntermediate-Acting - This insulin starts working within 2-4 hours after you use it. It reaches its highest level in your blood around 6-8 hours after you use it. It is often used to help control your blood sugar between meals. Some people use this type of insulin in the morning, at bedtime, or both.\nLong-Acting - This insulin starts working within 2 to 4 hours after you use it. It can last in the body for up to 24 hours. It is often used in the morning or at bedtime to help control your blood sugar throughout the day.\nPre-Mixed - This is a mix of two different types of insulin. It includes one type that helps to control your blood sugar at meals and another type that helps between meals.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBrand Name\nOther Names\nType of Insulin\n\t\t\t(How Fast Insulin Works)\n\n\n\n\nAdmelog    \ninsulin lispro injection\nRapid-Acting\n\n\nAfrezza (inhalation powder)\n\nregular human insulin \n\nRapid-Acting\n\n\nApidra\n\t\t\tApidra Solostar\ninsulin glulisine\nRapid-Acting\n\n\nFiasp\n\t\t\tFiasp Flextouch\ninsulin aspart\nRapid-Acting\n\n\nHumalog\n\t\t\tHumalog Pen\n\t\t\tHumalog Kwikpen\ninsulin lispro\nRapid-Acting\n\n\nNovolog\ninsulin aspart\nRapid-Acting\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nHumulin R\n\t\t\tHumulin R Pen\nregular human insulin\nShort-Acting\n\n\nNovolin R\nregular human insulin\nShort-Acting\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nHumulin N\nNPH human insulin\n\t\t\t(human insulin isophane suspension)\nIntermediate-Acting\n\n\nNovolin N\nNPH human insulin\n\t\t\t(human insulin isophane suspension)\nIntermediate-Acting\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nBasaglar KwikPen\ninsulin glargine\nLong-Acting\n\n\nLantus\n\t\t\tLantus Solostar\ninsulin glargine\nLong-Acting\n\n\nLevemir\ninsulin detemir\nLong-Acting\n\n\nToujeo\n\t\t\tToujeo Max\ninsulin glargine\nLong-Acting\n\n\nTresiba FlexTouch\ninsulin degludec\nLong-Acting\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nHumalog Mix 75/25\n\t\t\tHumalog Mix 75/25 KwikPen\n75% insulin lispro protamine suspension\n\t\t\t25% insulin lispro injection\nIntermediate- and Rapid-Acting\n\n\nHumalog 70/30\n70% human insulin isophane suspension\n\t\t\t30% human insulin injection\nIntermediate- and Rapid-Acting\n\n\nHumalog Mix 50/50\n\t\t\tHumalog Mix 50/50 KwikPen\n50% insulin lispro protamine suspension\n\t\t\t50% insulin lispro injection\nIntermediate- and Rapid-Acting\n\n\nNovoLog Mix 70/30\n\t\t\tNovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen\n70% insulin aspart protamine suspension\n\t\t\t30% insulin aspart injection\nIntermediate- and Rapid-Acting\n\n\nRyzodeg 70/30 FlexTouch\n\n70% insulin degludec\n30% insulin aspart\n\nLong- and Rapid-Acting\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nHumulin 70/30\n\t\t\tHumulin 70/30 KwikPen\n70% NPH human insulin\n\t\t\t30% regular human insulin injection\nIntermediate- and Short-Acting\n\n\nNovolin 70/30\n70% NPH Human Insulin\n\t\t\t30% Regular Human Insulin Injection\nIntermediate- and Short-Acting\n\n\n\n\nInsulin Tip: Do not store your insulin in a place that is very hot or very cold.\nBack to Top\n\nInsulin Side Effects\nInsulin affects each person differently.

Some people use a needle and syringe to inject their insulin. Others use an insulin pen, jet injectors, inhaler, or pump. Read the information in this section about the different kinds of insulin devices. Then, talk to healthcare provider about the kind that is best for you.\nInsulin Needles and Syringes\nNeedles and syringes are used to inject insulin under the skin. Insulin needles come in different sizes. Most needles have a special coating to help them go through the skin with as little pain as possible.\n\nDo not share your needles or syringes with others.\nAsk your healthcare provider which kind of needle is right for you.\n\nInsulin Pens\nInsulin pens are devices that look like regular pens with a fine short needle on the tip. The pens have enough insulin in them for a few injections. Some pens have a case filled with insulin that you change when it is empty. Other pens are thrown away when the case is empty.\n\nPut a new needle on the tip of the pen each time you give yourself an injection (shot).\nMake sure that you use the type of insulin and needle for your kind of pen.\nDo not share your insulin pen or cartridge with others.\n\nInsulin Jet Injectors\nInsulin jet injectors use strong air pressure to spray insulin through the skin.\n\nInsulin jet injectors do not use needles.\nAsk your health care provider to show you how to safely use your jet injector.\n\nInsulin Pumps\nInsulin pumps are worn on the outside of your body. The pump is connected to your body by a flexible tube that has a tip that sticks under your skin. A cartridge of insulin is put in the pump. The insulin flows through the tube into your body.\n\nThe pump controls how much insulin goes into your body.\nThe pump can give you insulin 24 hours a day.\n\nInsulin Inhalers\nInsulin inhalers are used to take a form of insulin that is breathed-in through your lungs (inhaled). A cartridge of insulin is put in the inhaler. After you put in the cartridge, keep the inhaler level so the drug powder does not come out.\n\nDo not turn the inhaler upside down.\nDo not point the mouthpiece down. \nDo not shake or drop the inhaler.\n\nInsulin Tip: There are tools called injection aids that can make it easier for you to inject your insulin. There are tools to help people that have problems seeing and people with physical disabilities. Ask your healthcare provider about tools to help you inject your insulin.\n\nTips for Insulin Devices\nEach insulin device is different. This page lists some basic tips about insulin devices. Talk to your health care provider to learn everything you should know about your insulin device.\nGeneral Tips\n\nNever share insulin needles (syringes) or devices.\nAsk your doctor or nurse to show you how to inject your insulin.\nAlways wash your hands before you inject your insulin.\nDo not inject your insulin in the exact same spot on your body each time.\n\t\nThe skin may get thick or thin if you use the same spot.\nInject in the same general area of your body.\n\n\nDo not use your insulin if it looks cloudy or looks like something is floating in it. Take it back to the drug store for a new one.\nDo not use insulin needles (syringes), pens, and injectors after the expiration date printed on the label or on the box.\n\nHow to Throw Away Used Devices\n\nFollow the directions on when to throw away the needles, pens or injectors.\nYou should throw away your used needles in a hard container like an empty laundry detergent bottle or a metal coffee can.\n\t\nMake sure the needles cannot poke through the container.\nPut a label on the container to warn people that it is dangerous.\nKeep the container where children cannot get to it.\nAlways put a lid or top on the container.\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\nYou Can Control Your Diabetes\n\nMake a plan. Work with your healthcare team to plan how you will manage your diabetes.\nCheck your blood sugar. Use your glucose meter to test your blood glucose (sugar) level.\nWatch what you eat. Work with your healthcare team to make a meal plan just for you.\nUse medicines wisely. Ask your health care provider when and how to safely use your diabetes medicines or insulin.\nBe active and get exercise. Dance, take a walk, or join an exercise class. Check with your doctor about safe ways to be more active.\nWatch your overall mental and physical health. Work with your healthcare team to keep your feet, eyes, heart, and teeth healthy.\n\nThis page should not be used in place of talking to your doctor or reading the label on your medicine.

        "topic": "Insulin Storage and Switching Between Products in an Emergency",
        "content": "en EspañolInsulin Storage and EffectivenessInsulin for InjectionInsulin from various manufacturers is often made available to patients in an emergency and may be different from a patient's usual insulin. After a disaster, patients in the affected area may not have access to refrigeration.  According to the product labels from all three U.S. insulin manufacturers, it is recommended that insulin be stored in a refrigerator at approximately 36°F to 46°F.  Unopened and stored in this manner, these products maintain potency until the expiration date on the package. Insulin products contained in vials or cartridges supplied by the manufacturers (opened or unopened) may be left unrefrigerated at a temperature between 59°F and 86°F for up to 28 days and continue to work.  However, an insulin product that has been altered for the purpose of dilution or by removal from the manufacturer’s original vial should be discarded within two weeks.Note:  Insulin loses some effectiveness when exposed to extreme temperatures. The longer the exposure to extreme temperatures, the less effective the insulin becomes.  This can result in loss of blood glucose control over time.  Under emergency conditions, you might still need to use insulin that has been stored above 86°F. You should try to keep insulin as cool as possible. If you are using ice, avoid freezing the insulin.  Do not use insulin that has been frozen.  Keep insulin away from direct heat and out of direct sunlight.When properly stored insulin becomes available again, the insulin vials that have been exposed to these extreme conditions should be discarded and replaced as soon as possible. If patients or healthcare providers have specific questions about the suitability of their insulin, they may call the respective manufacturer at the following numbers:Lilly: 1-800-545-5979Sanofi-Aventis: 1-800-633-1610Novo Nordisk: 1-800-727-6500Additional Storage Information for Insulin PumpsInsulin contained in the infusion set of a pump device (e.g., reservoir, tubing, catheters) should be discarded after 48 hours.  Insulin contained in the infusion set of a pump device and exposed to temperature exceeding 98.6°F should be discarded.Insulin SwitchingSwitching insulin should always be done in consultation with a physician and requires close medical supervision, and if possible, close monitoring of blood glucose. If medical supervision is not possible under emergency conditions, the following recommendations may be considered. Make sure to closely monitor your blood glucose and seek medical attention as soon as possible.Short-acting (regular insulin) and Rapid-acting InsulinsOne brand of regular insulin (e.g., Humulin R, Novolin R) may be substituted for another brand of regular insulin and for rapid-acting insulins (e.g., Humalog, NovoLog, Apidra), and vice versa, on a unit-per-unit basis in emergency conditions.Regular insulins are to be injected approximately 30 minutes before the start of each meal. Rapid-acting insulins begin working more rapidly than regular insulin and are to be injected no more than 15 minutes before the start of each meal to avoid dangerously low blood glucose levels.Intermediate and Long-acting InsulinsOne intermediate-acting insulin product (e.g., Humulin N, Novolin N) may be substituted for another intermediate-acting insulin product on a unit-per-unit basis in emergency conditions. Likewise, these intermediate insulins may also be substituted for long-acting insulins (e.g., Lantus, Levemir) on a total unit-per-day basis, or vice versa in emergency conditions.  Importantly, when switching from a once a day long-acting insulin (e.g., Lantus, Levemir) to an intermediate-acting insulin the dose of the once a day long-acting insulin should be cut in half and given as two injections of intermediate acting insulin, one in the morning with breakfast and one in the evening with dinner to avoid dangerously low blood glucose levels.When switching from an intermediate-acting to a once a day long-acting insulin, add up the total amount of intermediate-acting insulin units for one day, and give it as a single long-acting insulin dose once a day. Close monitoring of blood glucose and adjustment in insulin dose may be needed in the transition period.Insulin MixesSwitching between types of insulin should be done in consultation with a physician and requires medical supervision, and if possible, close monitoring of blood glucose.What is an Insulin MixInsulin mixes contain a ratio of intermediate- and short/rapid-acting insulin.  The first number denotes the quantity of intermediate insulin and the second number denotes the quantity of short/rapid-acting insulin delivered with each dose administered.  For example, each dose of a 70/30 mix contains 70% intermediate-acting insulin and 30% short/rapid-acting insulin.Switching from Your Insulin Mix: Substitution or ReplacementPatients using pre-mixed insulin products (e.g., Humulin 70/30, Humalog Mix 75/25, Novolin 70/30, NovoLog Mix 70/30) have the following options to consider:In emergency conditions, one insulin mix product may be substituted for another on a unit-per-unit basis. Insulin mixes containing a rapid-acting insulin analog (e.g., Humalog Mix, Novolog Mix) should be injected closer (within 15 minutes) to the start of the meal compared to mixes containing regular insulin (e.g., Humulin 70/30). If an insulin mix is not available, patients should follow this two-step process: First, substitute an intermediate-acting component of the mix (e.g., for most of the examples listed above this will be approximately 70% of the total units for each dose) with an intermediate-acting or a long-acting insulin on a unit-per-unit basis. Substituting with an intermediate-acting insulin: Give 70% of total units for each doseSubstituting with a long-acting insulin: Add up the total insulin units given in one dayGive 70% as one daily dose Second, if regular or rapid-acting insulins are also available, they may be used before major meals in doses equivalent to approximately 30% of the total dose of pre-mixed insulin and in combination with the intermediate- or long-acting insulin usually taken before that meal.  Note: Inject longer and shorter acting insulins separately unless directed otherwise by a physician. Insulin PumpsSwitching between types of insulin should be done in consultation with a physician and requires medical supervision, and if possible, close monitoring of blood glucose.Using a Different Insulin in Your Insulin PumpPatients administering insulin using a pump device may be able to substitute rapid-acting insulin (e.g., Humalog, Novolog, Apidra) for another on a unit-per-unit basis in emergency conditions.  Patients should check the instructions for use of the pump device to see if available insulins are compatible with their devices.Switching from an Insulin Pump to Injected InsulinPatients using insulin pumps who must switch to injected insulin may substitute intermediate or long-acting insulin for the total “basal” dose infused over 24-hours on a unit-per-unit basis in emergency conditions. For example, an individual using a pump with a basal rate of 1 unit per hour has a total 24-hour “basal” dose of 24 units.For an intermediate insulin, the 24 units should generally be administered as two injections of 12 units, and for a long-acting insulin, the 24 units should generally be administered as one injection daily.If regular or rapid-acting insulin is also available, patients should administer these insulins with each meal. The individual should substitute their meal time “bolus” dose on a unit-per-unit basis to an injected dose. For example, an individual using a “bolus” dose of 5 units on the pump to cover the breakfast meal should inject 5 units of regular or rapid-acting insulin to cover the breakfast meal.Back to Natural Disaster ResponseResourcesForYouSafe Drug Use After a Natural Disaster"

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nAs the number of people diagnosed with diabetes continues to grow, an increasing number of products marketed under the guise of “dietary supplements” or “over-the-counter drugs” promising to prevent, treat, and even cure diabetes are being sold illegally.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises consumers not to use such products - for many reasons. For example, they may contain harmful ingredients or no active ingredients at all. They may also be improperly marketed as nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs or dietary supplements when they have hidden prescription drugs in the product. \nThese products carry an additional risk if they cause people to delay or discontinue effective treatments for diabetes. \nMore than 38 million people in the U.S. have diabetes, and almost 1-in-4 adults don't know they have it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, approximately 96 million adults have pre-diabetes, meaning they have higher than normal blood sugar levels and can reduce their risks of developing diabetes through lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise.\nPeople with diabetes are at a greater risk for developing serious health complications, including:\n\nDeath\nHeart disease\nChronic kidney disease, \nNerve damage, \nFoot health, \nOral health, \nHearing loss, \nVision loss, \nMental health\n\nA Far-Reaching Problem\nProducts that promise an easy fix might be tempting, but you are gambling with your health if you choose an unapproved, unregulated, or fraudulent product. \nDiabetes is a chronic disease but is generally manageable. You can lower your risk for developing complications by following treatments prescribed by health care professionals, carefully monitoring blood sugar levels, and sticking to an appropriate diet and exercise program.\nUnfortunately, “snake-oil peddlers” still prey on people with chronic or incurable diseases, such as diabetes. \nBogus products for diabetes are particularly troubling because there are effective options available to help manage this serious disease rather than risk exposing patients to unapproved or dangerous products.\nOne way to tell if a diabetes product is unsafe or ineffective is if it is marketed as a nonprescription product or dietary supplement. \nFDA-approved diabetes drugs are only available by prescription. Additionally, there are no dietary supplements that treat or cure diabetes. In fact, the FDA requires dietary supplement products to be labeled with a disclaimer saying the product is not intended to \"diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.\" You can read more about how to identify fraudulent products at 6 Tip-offs to Rip-offs: Don't Fall for Health Fraud Scams.\nTo protect the public health, the FDA investigates consumer complaints and monitors the marketplace for fraudulent products, including those promising to treat diabetes and its complications.\nUnapproved Diabetes Drugs\nThe FDA issues warning letters to various companies marketing products for diabetes in violation of federal law. These products are often marketed as:\n\nDietary supplements\nAlternative medicines \nOver-the-counter or nonprescription drugs\nHomeopathic products\n\nIn September 2021, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission issued warning letters to 10 companies for illegally selling dietary supplements claiming to cure, treat, mitigate, or prevent diabetes.\nFDA laboratories find some “all-natural” diabetes products contain hidden active ingredients found in approved prescription drugs used to treat diabetes. You may ask, what the harm is if the products contain these undeclared active ingredients? Don’t be fooled, these are illegal products and can be dangerous. \nIf consumers, and their health care professionals, are unaware of the actual active ingredients in the products they are taking, these products may interact in dangerous ways with other medications. One possible complication: patients may end up taking a larger combined dose of the diabetic drugs than they intended. This may cause a significant and unsafe drop in blood sugar levels, a condition known as hypoglycemia.\nFraudulent Pharmacies\nThe FDA also monitors the internet for illegal marketing of prescription drugs or potentially unsafe products by fraudulent online pharmacies. \nBuying medicines from unsafe online pharmacies may put consumers at risk. These websites often sell unapproved, counterfeit, or otherwise unsafe medicines outside of safeguards followed by licensed pharmacies. The products sold, while being passed off as authentic or effective, may contain the wrong ingredients, contain too little, too much, or no active ingredient at all, or contain other harmful ingredients.\nAdditionally, consumers cannot be certain the manufacturing or handling of these drugs follows U.S. laws or meets other necessary safeguards, such as storing the medicine at the right temperature, which is extremely important for diabetes medicine, such as insulin, to ensure it doesn’t lose or have decreased effectiveness.  \nVisit BeSafeRx for more information about the potential dangers of buying drugs from unsafe websites, tips for purchasing medicines online safely and how to report unlawful sales. \nThe FDA maintains a list of Internet Pharmacy Warning Letters issued to companies for:\n\nSelling illegally marketed products\nSelling counterfeit drugs\nOffering prescription drugs without a prescription\nOffering prescription drugs without adequate directions for safe use\nOffering prescription drugs without FDA-required consumer warnings about the serious health risks associated with the prescription drug\n\nIdentifying Legitimate Online Pharmacies\nTo help ensure you select a safe, licensed online pharmacy, look for one that requires you to have a valid prescription to purchase prescription drugs, provides a physical business address in the U.S., is licensed by a state pharmacy board, and provides a state-licensed pharmacist to answer your questions. You can find your state’s pharmacy board using the FDA’s Locate a State-Licensed Online Pharmacy webpage.\nTalk to your health care professional if you have any questions about your diabetes treatment or if a specific online pharmacy is safe to use. \nHow to Report\nIf you believe you have found a website that may be illegally selling human drugs, dietary supplements, or other medical products, we encourage you to submit the information through the Reporting Unlawful Sales of Medical Products on the Internet available on the FDA website.\nHealth care professionals and consumers should report any problems or reactions—often referred to as potential adverse reactions—to FDA’s MedWatch program at www.fda.gov/Medwatch/report.htm. Or, you can call 800-FDA-1088 (800-332-1088), send a fax to 800-FDA-0178, or mail FDA form 3500 (available on the MedWatch “Download Forms” page) to the address on the pre-addressed form.\nback to top"

You are not alone. There are about 6 million pregnancies in the U.S. each year, and 80% of those who are pregnant say that they take at least one medicine. Some may be getting treatment for a health problem they had before pregnancy, while others take medicines for health problems, like diabetes, morning sickness, or high blood pressure, that can start or get worse during pregnancy. Still others take medicines or get a vaccine before they find out they are pregnant.\nPregnancy can be an exciting time. It can also make you feel uneasy if you are not sure whether the medicines you are taking may affect your developing fetus. Many medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. For other medicines, there may be less information about whether they are safe to use during pregnancy.\nHere are some tips to help you learn more about how prescription and over-the-counter medicines might affect you and your baby.\nAsk questions\nAlways talk with your health care provider before you take any medicines, dietary supplements, or vitamins. \nConsider asking these questions when talking with your health care provider:\n\nWill I need to change my medicines if I want to get pregnant or if I find out I am pregnant? Before you get pregnant, make a plan with your health care provider to help you safely use your medicines.\nHow might this medicine affect my pregnancy? Ask your health care provider about the benefits and risks of taking this medicine. \nAre there medicines and supplements I should avoid? Some medicines may harm your developing fetus during different stages of pregnancy. Your health care provider may have you take something else while you are pregnant.\nWill I need to take more or less of my medicine? Your heart and kidneys work harder when you are pregnant. This may make some medicines pass through your body faster than usual.\nCan I keep taking this medicine when I start breastfeeding? Some medicines can get into your breast milk and may affect your baby.\nWhat medicines should I take when I am pregnant? Ask your health care provider what medicines to take while pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n\nPrenatal vitamins\nTalk with your health care provider about taking prenatal vitamins. Some prenatal vitamins may have too much or too little of what you might need during pregnancy. \nWhat is folic acid? Folic acid helps to prevent birth defects of the baby’s brain or spine. Ask your health care provider about how much folic acid you should take before you become pregnant and through the first part of your pregnancy.  \n\nRead the label\nCheck the medicine label and other information you get with your medicine to learn about the possible risks during pregnancy. The label tells you what is known about how the medicine might affect you and your developing fetus.\nFind information on a certain medicine\nPrescription medicine information\nPrescription medicine labels contain helpful information about a medicine's risks during pregnancy. The labels may also have information on whether the medicine gets into breast milk and how it could possibly affect the baby.\nBe smart online\nAsk your health care provider about the information you read online. Some websites say certain medicines are or are not safe to take during pregnancy. You should always check with your health care provider first. Do not trust that a product is safe just because it says \"natural.\"\n\n\nCheck with your health care provider before you use a product that you heard about in a chat room or on social media.\n\n\nResources\n\nFDA Pharmacists Help You Use Medicines Safely\nMedicine and Pregnancy (from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\n\nMarijuana, CBD, and THC \nFDA wants to ensure that individuals are aware of the serious risks of using cannabis products, including the use of cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and marijuana in any form during pregnancy or while breastfeeding/lactating due to possible risks to you and the newborn.\nUsing any form of cannabis products while pregnant can affect fetal brain development, increase the risk of a newborn with low birth weight, premature birth, and potentially still birth. Breastmilk can contain THC for up to six days after use. Consuming breastmilk containing THC may affect a newborn’s brain development and result in hyperactivity, poor cognitive function, and other long-term consequences. Research has shown that there are also risks to you such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and placental abruption.\nCannabis products claiming to be, or promoted as, treatments for relief of pain, anxiety, or morning sickness are not FDA-approved and are being sold with unproven claims. \n\nReport problems\nFirst, tell your health care provider about any problems you have with your medicine. Also, tell FDA about any serious problems you have after taking a medicine. \nWhat products are regulated by FDA\nYou should report problems like serious side effects and product quality problems. You should also report product use errors, such as accidentally taking the wrong dose or wrong medicine, that are related to unclear use or dosing instructions. Report problems or use errors with these products:\n\nHuman medicines, including vaccines\nMedical devices\nBlood products and other biologics \nMedical foods prescribed by a health care provider and intended to help manage a disease or health condition (this does not include meal replacements or diet shakes)\n\nTypes of issues you should report to FDA MedWatch\n\nUnexpected side effects or adverse events\nProduct quality problems\nProduct use/medication errors that can be prevented\nTherapeutic failures\n\nHow to report\n\nCall 1-800-FDA-1088 to get a reporting form sent to you by mail.\nReport problems to FDA online. Learn more about reporting problems to FDA.\nFor vaccines, report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) online.\n\n\nVolunteer to sign up for a pregnancy exposure registry\nPregnancy exposure registries are research studies that collect information about the effect that prescription medicines taken or vaccines received during pregnancy may have on you and your developing fetus. These studies collect information from those who are pregnant and who are taking or have taken a certain medicine or received a certain vaccine while pregnant. Some pregnancy exposure registries collect information from those who are pregnant but have not taken a certain medicine or received a certain vaccine. Some pregnancy exposure registry studies also collect information about newborn babies for a period of time after birth. \nYou can volunteer to join a pregnancy exposure registry (if one is open and enrolling). The information collected can help health care providers and others who are pregnant to learn more about the safety of medicines and vaccines used during pregnancy.  \n\nHelp others who are pregnant by sharing your experiences with medicines and vaccines.\nYou will be asked to provide information about your health and possibly your baby's health.\n\n\n\nFDA has a list of ongoing pregnancy exposure registries on its website but does not run the pregnancy exposure registry studies. The drug companies that make the medicines and vaccines are usually in charge of the pregnancy exposure registry for their product. Sometimes, these research studies are run by other researchers. See if there is a pregnancy registry research study for your medicine or vaccine.\n\n\nTo learn more about pregnancy exposure registries visit www.fda.gov/pregnancyregistries\nRelated links\n\nGet information about a specific drug\nPregnant?

An estimated 30 million people in the United States are living with diabetes. About 1 in 4 people living with diabetes don’t know they have it. Diabetes disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities and other diverse groups.\nWhat is diabetes?\nDiabetes is a disease that happens when the level of glucose in your blood (blood sugar) is too high. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that helps move sugar out of your blood and into your cells for energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Symptoms of diabetes include:\n\nIncreased thirst and urination\nIncreased hunger\nFatigue\nBlurred vision\nSores that do not heal\nUnexplained weight loss\nNumbness or tingling in the feet or hands\n\nThere are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2.\nType 1 diabetes happens when your body does not make insulin because your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that make insulin. Although it can appear at any age, type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. You are at higher risk for type 1 diabetes if you have a parent, brother, or sister with type 1 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes happens when your body does not make or use insulin well. It is usually diagnosed in adults. Some factors that put you at higher risk for type 2 diabetes include:\n\nBeing overweight or obese\nBeing 45 years or older\nNot being physically active\nHaving a family history of diabetes\nEver having gestational diabetes\n\nWho is affected by diabetes?\nOver 1 in 10 adults in the United States are living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Racial and ethnic minorities and other diverse groups have a high burden of diabetes and diabetes-related complications. For example, American Indian/Alaska Native adults are almost three times more likely than non-Hispanic white adults to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\nDiabetes products cleared or approved by the FDA\nPeople living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes use glucose meters and test strips to monitor their blood sugar every day. The results help you determine your daily adjustments in treatment, know if you have high or low levels of glucose, and understand how your diet and exercise change your glucose levels.\nPeople living with type 1 diabetes need to give themselves insulin shots every day to stay alive and healthy. They can also receive small, steady doses of insulin throughout the day using an insulin pump or an automated insulin dosing device.\nMany people with type 2 diabetes may need to take diabetes medications. These may include pills, insulin, or other injectable medications.\nDiabetes and clinical trials\nThe FDA encourages diverse participation in clinical trials. If you think a clinical trial may be right for you, talk to your health care provider. You can also search for clinical trials in your area at www.ClinicalTrials.gov.\nFor more information on health equity, visit www.fda.gov/healthequity.\n\nDownload Diabetes Resources\n \n\n\nFact Sheet: Diabetes\nBrochure: Living With Type 2 Diabetes\nInfographics:\n\nWhat is Type 2 Diabetes?\nDiabetes and Older Adults\n\n\nNotecard: A1c Test For Diabetes\n\nAdditional Languages\nWe hope that you find these translations useful.

        "content": "What does this test do? This is a test system for use at home or in health care settings to measure the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood.\nWhat is glucose? Glucose is a sugar that your body uses as a source of energy. Unless you have diabetes, your body regulates the amount of glucose in your blood. People with diabetes may need special diets and medications to control blood glucose.\nWhat type of test is this? This is a quantitative test, which means that you will find out the amount of glucose present in your blood sample.\nWhy should you take this test? You should take this test if you have diabetes and you need to monitor your blood sugar (glucose) levels. You and your doctor can use the results to:\n\ndetermine your daily adjustments in treatment\nknow if you have dangerously high or low levels of glucose\nunderstand how your diet and exercise change your glucose levels\n\nThe Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (1993) showed that good glucose control using home monitors led to fewer disease complications.\nHow often should you test your glucose? Follow your doctor's recommendations about how often you test your glucose. You may need to test yourself several times each day to determine adjustments in your diet or treatment.\nWhat should your glucose levels be?According to the American Diabetes Association (Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes – 2017.  Diabetes Care, January 2017, vol. 40, Supplement 1, S11-S24) the blood glucose levels for an adult without diabetes are below 100 mg/dL before meals and fasting and are less than 140 mg/dL two hours after meals.\nPeople with diabetes should consult their doctor or health care provider to set appropriate blood glucose goals. You should treat your low or high blood glucose as recommended by your health care provider.\nHow accurate is this test? The accuracy of this test depends on many factors including:\n\nthe quality of your meter\nthe quality of your test strips\n\t\nAlways use new test strips that are authorized for sale in the United States. The FDA has issued a safety communication warning about the risks of using previously owned test strips or test strips that are not authorized for sale in the United States\n\n\nhow well you perform the test. For example, you should wash and dry your hands before testing and closely follow the instructions for operating your meter.\nyour hematocrit (the amount of red blood cells in the blood). If you are severely dehydrated or anemic, your test results may be less accurate. Your health care provider can tell you if your hematocrit is low or high, and can discuss with you how it may affect your glucose testing.\ninterfering substances (Some substances, such as Vitamin C, Tylenol, and uric acid, may interfere with your glucose testing). Check the instructions for your meter and test strips to find out what substances may affect the testing accuracy.\naltitude, temperature, and humidity (High altitude, low and high temperatures, and humidity can cause unpredictable effects on glucose results). Check the meter manual and test strip package insert for more information.\nstore and handle the meter and strips according to manufacturer's instructions. It is important to store test strip vials closed.\n\nHow do you take this test? Before you test your blood glucose, you must read and understand the instructions for your meter. In general, you prick your finger with a lancet to get a drop of blood. Then you place the blood on a disposable \"test strip\" that is inserted in your meter. The test strip contains chemicals that react with glucose. Some meters measure the amount of electricity that passes through the test strip. Others measure how much light reflects from it. In the U.S., meters report results in milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood, or mg/dl.\nYou can get information about your meter and test strips from several different sources, including the toll-free number in the manual that comes with your meter or on the manufacturer's web site. If you have an urgent problem, always contact your health care provider or a local emergency room for advice.\nHow do you choose a Glucose Meter? There are many different types of meters available for purchase that differ in several ways, including:\n\naccuracy\namount of blood needed for each test\nhow easy it is to use\npain associated with using the product\ntesting speed\noverall size\nability to store test results in memory\nlikelihood of interferences\nability to transmit data to a computer\ncost of the meter\ncost of the test strips used\ndoctor's recommendation\ntechnical support provided by the manufacturer\nspecial features such as automatic timing, error codes, large display screen, or spoken instructions or results\n\nTalk to your health care provider about the right glucose meter for you, and how to use it.\nHow can you check your meter's performance? There are three ways to make sure your meter works properly:\n\nUse liquid control solutions:\n\t\nevery time you open a new container of test strips\noccasionally as you use the container of test strips\nif you drop the meter\nwhenever you get unusual results\n\n\tTo test a liquid control solution, you test a drop of these solutions just like you test a drop of your blood. The value you get should match the value written on the test strip vial label.\nUse electronic checks. Every time you turn on your meter, it does an electronic check. If it detects a problem it will give you an error code. Look in your meter's manual to see what the error codes mean and how to fix the problem. If you are unsure if your meter is working properly, call the toll-free number in your meter's manual, or contact your health care provider.\nCompare your meter with a blood glucose test performed in a laboratory. Take your meter with you to your next appointment with your health care provider. Ask your provider to watch your testing technique to make sure you are using the meter correctly. Ask your health care provider to have your blood tested with a laboratory method. If the values you obtain on your glucose meter match the laboratory values, then your meter is working well and you are using good technique.\n\nWhat should you do if your meter malfunctions? If your meter malfunctions, you should tell your health care provider and contact the company that made your meter and strips.\nCan you test blood glucose from sites other than your fingers? Some meters allow you to test blood from sites other than the fingertip. Examples of such alternative sampling sites are your palm, upper arm, forearm, thigh, or calf. Alternative site testing (AST) should not be performed at times when your blood glucose may be changing rapidly, as these alternative sampling sites may provide inaccurate results at those times. You should use only blood from your fingertip to test if any of the following applies:\n\nyou have just taken insulin\nyou think your blood sugar is low\nyou are not aware of symptoms when you become hypoglycemic\nthe results do not agree with the way you feel\nyou have just eaten\nyou have just exercised\nyou are ill\nyou are under stress\n\nAlso, you should never use results from an alternative sampling site to calibrate a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), or in insulin dosing calculations.\n Useful Links:\n\nFDA expands indication for continuous glucose monitoring system, first to replace fingerstick testing for diabetes treatment decisions \nHow to Safely Use Glucose Meters and Test Strips for Diabetes\nHow to Report Problems with Glucose Meters and Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems \nUsers of Blood Glucose Meters Must Use Only the Test Strip Recommended For Use With Their Meter\nNIH Medline Plus - Diabetes\nThe FDA Warns Against Use of Previously Owned Test Strips or Test Strips Not Authorized for Sale in the United States: FDA Safety Communication"

Limpiar\nLávese siempre las manos y limpie muy bien los alimentos, los mesones de la cocina y los utensilios para cocinar.\n\nLávese las manos con agua tibia y jabón por lo menos durante 20 segundos. Hágalo antes y después de tocar algún alimento.\nLave las planchas para cortar, los platos, tenedores, cucharas, cuchillos y los mesones de la cocina con agua caliente y jabón. Hágalo después de preparar cada tipo de alimento.\nEnjuague las frutas y las verduras.\nNo lave carnes, aves de granja, pescado ni huevos. Si el agua salpica del fregadero durante el proceso de lavado, puede propagar bacterias.\nLimpie las tapas de los alimentos enlatados antes de abrirlos.\n\n2. Separar (Mantener aparte)\nMantenga los alimentos crudos separados por tipo. Los gérmenes pueden pasar de un alimento a otro.\n\nMantenga la carne, pollo, pescado, mariscos y huevos separados de otros alimentos. Hágalo en el carrito de la compra, en las bolsas y en la refrigeradora.\nNo vuelva a utilizar los adobos que utilizó para marinar alimentos crudos, a menos que los hierva primero.\nUtilice una plancha o un plato especial para cortar solamente alimentos crudos.\n\n3. Cocinar\nLos alimentos tienen que calentarse y mantenerse calientes, porque el calor mata los gérmenes.\n\nCocine a temperaturas seguras:\n\t\nCarne de res, cerdo, cordero 160oF\nPescado 145oF\nCarnes molidas de res, cerdo, cordero 160oF\ny de pavo, pollo, pato 165oF\n\n\nUtilice un termómetro especial para alimentos que le permita asegurarse que el alimento no está crudo. No siempre es posible saberlo solamente con mirarlo.\n\n4. Refrigerar\nPonga los alimentos en la refrigeradora en seguida. \n\nNorma de las dos horas: Ponga los alimentos en la refrigeradora o el congelador dentro de las dos horas siguientes a la cocción o la compra. Si la temperatura exterior es de 90 grados o más, no deje pasar más de una hora sin refrigerar los alimentos.\nNunca descongele los alimentos sacándolos de la refrigeradora. Para hacerlo:\n\t\nDéjelos en la refrigeradora\nSumérjalos en agua fría\nColóquelos en el horno de microondas\n\n\nPara marinar los alimentos manténgalos en la refrigeradora.\n\n\n\nInocuidad de los alimentos en el hogar\n¿Por qué debe preocuparse que los alimentos estén frescos?\nTodos los años millones de personas se enferman debido al consumo de alimentos contaminados. Las enfermedades causadas por los alimentos pueden hacerlo sentir como si tuviera gripe. Estas enfermedades pueden crear graves problemas de salud y hasta causar la muerte.  \n¿Piensa que tiene una enfermedad causada por algún alimento? Llame a su médico y busque atención médica en seguida.\n\nGuarde el empaque, lata o cartón del alimento.\nLlame al USDA al 1-888-674-6854 para pedir información sobre carnes, pollo o huevos.\nLlame a la FDA al 1-866-300-4374 por todos los demás alimentos.\nLlame al departamento de salud local si piensa que se enfermó después de comer algún alimento en un restaurante u otro lugar de venta de alimentos.\n\n¿Quién está en riesgo?\nCualquiera puede enfermarse si come algún alimento en mal estado. Algunas personas están más propensas a sufrir alguna enfermedad causada por los alimentos.\n\nEmbarazadas\nAdultos mayores\nPersonas con ciertas enfermedades como cáncer, VIH/SIDA, diabetes y enfermedad renal\n\nAlgunos alimentos crean más riesgos para estas personas. Hable con su médico u otro profesional de salud acerca de los alimentos que puede comer sin peligro.\nRecursos para usted\n\nfoodsafety.gov en Español"

These similarities help to demonstrate bioequivalence, which means that a generic medicine works in the same way and provides the same clinical benefit as the brand-name medicine. In other words, you can take a generic medicine as an equal substitute for its brand-name counterpart.\n\n\nAdditional Resource\n\n\n\nGeneric Drug Facts\n\tAt-a-glance information on generic medicines, including why they may look different or cost less than brand-name medicines.\n\n\n\nHow does FDA ensure generic medicines work the same as brand-name medicines?\nAny generic medicine must perform the same in the body as the brand-name medicine. It must be the same as a brand-name medicine in dosage,  form and route of administration, safety, effectiveness, strength, and labeling (with certain limited exceptions).  It must also meet the same high standards of quality and manufacturing as the brand-name product, and it must be and quality, taken and used in the same way as well. This standard applies to all generic medicines.\nGeneric medicines use the same active ingredients as brand-name medicines and work the same way, so they have the same risks and benefits as the brand-name medicines. The FDA Generic Drugs Program conducts a rigorous review to ensure generic medicines meet these standards, in addition to conducting inspections of manufacturing plants and monitoring drug safety after the generic medicine has been approved and brought to market.\nA generic drug may have certain minor differences from the brand-name product, such as different inactive ingredients. \nIt is important to note that there will always be a slight, but not medically significant, level of expected variability—just as there is for one batch of brand-name medicine compared with the next batch of brand-name product. This variability can and does occur during manufacturing, for both brand-name and generic medicines. When a medicine, generic or brand-name, is mass produced, very small variations in purity, size, strength, and other parameters are permitted. FDA limits how much variability is acceptable.\nFor example, a very large research study1 comparing generics with brand-name medicines, found that there were very small differences (approximately 3.5%) in absorption into the body between generic and brand-name medicines. Some generics were absorbed slightly more, some slightly less. This amount of difference is expected and clinically acceptable, whether for one batch of brand-name medicine tested against another batch of the same brand, or for a generic tested against a brand-name medicine. \n\n\nAdditional Resource\n\n\n\nResearch study: Clinical equivalence of generic and brand-name drugs used in cardiovascular disease\n\tA study of 38 published clinical trials showed no evidence that brand-name heart medicines worked any better than generic heart medicines.\n\n\n\nWhy does a generic drug look different from the brand drug?\nTrademark laws in the United States do not allow a generic drug to look exactly like other drugs already on the market. Generic medicines and brand-name medicines share the same active ingredient, but other characteristics, such as colors and flavorings, that do not affect the performance, safety, or effectiveness of the generic medicine, may be different.\n\n\nAdditional Resource\n\n\n\nThe importance of the physical characteristics of generic drugs\n\tRead a discussion of FDA’s guidance recommending that generic applicants design and develop generic drugs with a similar size and shape to the brand name product.\n\n\n\nWhy do generic medicines often cost less than the brand-name medicines?\nGeneric drugs are approved only after a rigorous review by FDA and after a set period of time that the brand product has been on the market exclusively. This is because new drugs, like other new products, are usually protected by patents that prohibit others from making and selling copies of the same drug.  \nGeneric drugs tend to cost less than their brand-name counterparts because generic drug applicants do not have to repeat animal and clinical (human) studies that were required of the brand-name medicines to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. This abbreviated pathway is why the application is called an “abbreviated new drug application.” \nThe reduction in upfront research costs means that, although generic medicines have the same therapeutic effect as their branded counterparts, they are typically sold at substantial discounts, an estimated 80 to 85% less, compared with the price of the brand-name medicine. According to the IMS Health Institute, generic drugs saved the U.S. healthcare system nearly $2.2 trillion from 2009 to 20192.\nWhen multiple generic companies are approved to market a single product, more competition exists in the marketplace, which typically results in lower prices for patients.\nBringing more drug competition to the market and addressing the high cost of medicines is one of FDA’s top priorities. In 2017, FDA announced the Drug Competition Action Plan (DCAP) to further encourage robust and timely market competition for generic drugs and help bring greater efficiency and transparency to the generic drug review process, without sacrificing the scientific rigor underlying our generic drug program.\nWhat standards must generic medicines meet to receive FDA approval?\nDrug companies must submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to FDA for approval to market a generic drug that is the same as (or bioequivalent to) the brand product. FDA reviews the application to ensure drug companies have demonstrated that the generic medicine can be substituted for the brand-name medicine that it copies.\nAn ANDA must show the generic medicine is equivalent to the brand in the following ways:\n\nThe active ingredient is the same as that of the brand-name drug/innovator drug.\n\t\nAn active ingredient in a medicine is the component that makes it pharmaceutically active — effective against the illness or condition it is treating.\nGeneric drug companies must provide scientific evidence that shows that their active ingredient is the same as that of the brand-name medicine they copy, and FDA must review that evidence.\n\n\nThe generic medicine is the same strength.\nThe medicine is the same type of product (such as a tablet or an injectable).\nThe medicine has the same route of administration (such as oral or topical).\nIt has the same use indications.\nThe inactive ingredients of the medicine are acceptable.\n\t\nSome differences, which must be shown to have no effect on how the medicine functions, are allowed between the generic and the brand-name product.\nGeneric drug companies must submit evidence that all the ingredients used in their products are acceptable, and FDA must review that evidence.\n\n\nIt lasts for at least the same amount of time.\n\t\nMost medicines break down, or deteriorate, over time.\nGeneric drug companies must do months-long \"stability tests\" to show that their products last for at least the same amount of time as the brand-name product.\n\n\nIt is manufactured under the same strict standards as the brand-name medicine.\n\t\nIt meets the same batch requirements for identity, strength, purity, and quality.\nThe manufacturer is capable of making the medicine correctly and consistently.\n\t\t\nGeneric drug manufacturers must explain how they intend to manufacture the medicine and must provide evidence that each step of the manufacturing process will produce the same result each time. FDA scientists review those procedures, and FDA inspectors go to the generic drug manufacturer's facility to verify that the manufacturer is capable of making the medicine consistently and to check that the information the manufacturer has submitted to FDA is accurate.\nOften, different companies are involved (such as one company manufacturing the active ingredient and another company manufacturing the finished medicine). Generic drug manufacturers must produce batches of the medicines they want to market and provide information about the manufacturing of those batches for FDA to review.\n\n\n\n\nThe container in which the medicine will be shipped and sold is appropriate.\nThe label is the same as the brand-name medicine's label.\n\t\nThe drug information label for the generic medicine should be the same as the brand-name label. One exception is if the brand-name drug is approved for more than one use and that use is protected by patents or exclusivities. A generic medicine can omit the protected use from its labeling and only be approved for a use that is not protected by patents or exclusivities, so long as that removal does not take away information needed for safe use. Labels for generic medicines can also contain certain changes when the drug is manufactured by a different company, such as a different lot number or company name.\n\n\nRelevant patents or exclusivities are addressed.\n\t\nAs an incentive to develop new medicines, drug companies are awarded patents and exclusivities that may delay FDA approval of applications for generic medicines. FDA must comply with the delays in approval that the patents and exclusivities impose.\n\n\n\nThe ANDA process does not, however, require the drug applicant to repeat costly animal and clinical (human studies) on ingredients or dosage forms already approved for safety and effectiveness. This allows generic medicines to be brought to market more quickly and at lower cost, allowing for increased access to medications by the public.\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\nWhat Is the Approval Process for Generic Drugs?\n\tDetailed information on the critical factors the FDA reviews to make sure a generic medicine is as safe and effective as the brand-name drug.\n\t \nThe Generic Drug Approval Process, CDER Conversation\n\tAn interview on how FDA reviews generic medicines with Ted Sherwood, Director, Office of Regulatory Operations, Office of Generic Drugs, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\t \nWhat Makes a Generic the Same as a Brand-Name Drug?\n\tDownload a high-resolution, printable PDF of this infographic (PDF - 431 KB).\n\n \n\nIs a generic of my brand-name medicine available?\n\n\nIn addition to asking your local pharmacist for assistance, there are three ways to find out if there is a generic of your brand-name medicine available:\n\nUse Drugs@FDA, a catalog of FDA-approved drug products, including their drug labeling.\n\n\t\nFirst, search by brand name.\nSecond, select the brand name product and note which products are listed under the section labeled “Therapeutic Equivalents for ...”\nProducts that include an ANDA (not NDA) number next to the name are generic products.\n\n\nUse the online version of the Orange Book.  \n\t\nFirst, search by proprietary or brand name. Note the active ingredient name.\nSecond, search again by the active ingredient name.\nScroll right to find the dosage form (for example: tablet) and strength.\nNext, scroll right to the TE Code column. If the TE column contains a code beginning with “A,” FDA has approved generic equivalents.\nFinally, look at the column “Appl No.” If the letter “A” appears before the number, that product is an FDA-approved generic for the brand-name drug.  \nFor very recent approvals, consult First Generic Drug Approvals.\n\n\n\nIf you are unable to locate a generic of your brand-name medicine, it may be that the brand-name medicine is still within the period of time when it has exclusive rights to the marketplace, which allows drug companies to recoup their costs for the initial research and marketing of the brand-name or innovator drug. It is only after both patent and other periods of exclusivity are resolved that FDA can approve a generic of the brand-name medicine.\nHow Does FDA monitor side effects or safety issues with generic medicines?\nFDA takes several actions to ensure safety and quality before and after a new or generic medicine is approved. When a generic drug application is submitted, FDA conducts a thorough examination of the data submitted by the applicant and evaluates information obtained by FDA investigators while inspecting the related testing and manufacturing facilities to ensure that every generic drug is safe, effective, high quality, and substitutable to the brand name drug.\nFDA staff continually monitors all approved drug products, including generics, to make certain the medicines at all levels of the supply chain, from active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to products being sold to consumers, are safe, effective, and high quality.\nFDA also monitors and investigates reports of negative patient side effects or other reactions. The investigations may lead to changes in how a product (brand-name and generic) is used or manufactured, and FDA will make recommendations to health care professionals and the public if the need arises.\nMedWatch is the FDA’s medical product safety reporting program. Health professionals, patients and consumers can use MedWatch to voluntarily report a serious adverse event, product quality problem, product use/medication error, or therapeutic inequivalence/failure that is suspected to be associated with the use of an FDA-regulated drug, biologic, medical device, dietary supplement or cosmetic.\nAdditional Resource\n\nPostmarketing Surveillance of Generic Drugs\n\tDownload a high-resolution, printable PDF of this infographic (PDF - 282 KB)\n\n \n\nWhere can I find more information about generic medicines?\nContact your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care provider for information on generic medicines.

        "topic": "using aspirin to prevent heart attack and stroke",
        "content": "You can walk into any pharmacy, grocery or convenience store and buy aspirin without a prescription. The Drug Facts label on medication products, will help you choose aspirin for relieving headache, pain, swelling, or fever. The Drug Facts label also gives directions that will help you use the aspirin so that it is safe and effective.\nBut what about using aspirin for a different use, time period, or in a manner that is not listed on the label? For example, using aspirin to lower the risk of heart attack and clot-related strokes. In these cases, the labeling information is not there to help you with how to choose and how to use the medicine safely. Since you don't have the labeling directions to help you, you need the medical knowledge of your doctor, nurse practitioner or other health professional.\nYou can increase the chance of getting the good effects and decrease the chance of getting the bad effects of any medicine by choosing and using it wisely. When it comes to using aspirin to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke, choosing and using wisely means: Know the facts and work with your health professional.\n\n FACT: Daily use of aspirin is not right for everyone\nAspirin has been shown to be helpful when used daily to lower the risk of heart attack, clot-related strokes and other blood flow problems in patients who have cardiovascular disease or who have already had a heart attack or stroke. Many medical professionals prescribe aspirin for these uses. There may be a benefit to daily aspirin use for you if you have some kind of heart or blood vessel disease, or if you have evidence of poor blood flow to the brain. However, the risks of long-term aspirin use may be greater than the benefits if there are no signs of, or risk factors for heart or blood vessel disease.\nEvery prescription and over-the-counter medicine has benefits and risks — even such a common and familiar medicine as aspirin. Aspirin use can result in serious side effects, such as stomach bleeding, bleeding in the brain, and kidney failure. No medicine is completely safe. By carefully reviewing many different factors, your health professional can help you make the best choice for you.\n\nWhen you don't have the labeling directions to guide you, you need the medical knowledge of your doctor, nurse practitioner, or other health professional.\n\n\n FACT: Daily aspirin can be safest when prescribed by a medical health professional\nBefore deciding if daily aspirin use is right for you, your health professional will need to consider:\n\nYour medical history and the history of your family members\nYour use of other medicines, including prescription and over-the-counter\nYour use of other products, such as dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals\nYour allergies or sensitivities, and anything that affects your ability to use the medicine\nWhat you have to gain, or the benefits, from the use of the medicine\nOther options and their risks and benefits\nWhat side effects you may experience\nWhat dose, and what directions for use are best for you\nHow to know when the medicine is working or not working for this use\n\n\nMake sure to tell your health professional all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use — even if only occasionally.\n\n\n FACT: Aspirin is a drug\nIf you are at risk for heart attack or stroke your doctor may prescribe aspirin to increase blood flow to the heart and brain. But any drug — including aspirin — can have harmful side effects, especially when mixed with other products. In fact, the chance of side effects increases with each new product you use.\nNew products include prescription and other over-the-counter medicines, dietary supplements (including vitamins and herbals), and sometimes foods and beverages. For instance, people who already use a prescribed medication to thin the blood should not use aspirin unless recommended by a health professional. There are also dietary supplements known to thin the blood. Using aspirin with alcohol or with another product that also contains aspirin, such as a cough-sinus drug, can increase the chance of side effects.\nYour health professional will consider your current state of health. Some medical conditions, such as pregnancy, uncontrolled high blood pressure, bleeding disorders, asthma, peptic (stomach) ulcers, liver and kidney disease, could make aspirin a bad choice for you.\n\nMake sure that all your health professionals are aware that you are using aspirin to reduce your risk of heart attack and clot-related strokes.\n\n\n FACT: Once your doctor decides that daily use of aspirin is for you, safe use depends on following your doctor's directions\nThere are no directions on the label for using aspirin to reduce the risk of heart attack or clot-related stroke. You may rely on your health professional to provide the correct information on dose and directions for use. Using aspirin correctly gives you the best chance of getting the greatest benefits with the fewest unwanted side effects. Discuss with your health professional the different forms of aspirin products that might be best suited for you.\nAspirin has been shown to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients who have cardiovascular disease or who have already had a heart attack or stroke, but not all over-the-counter pain and fever reducers do that. Even though the directions on the aspirin label do not apply to this use of aspirin, you still need to read the label to confirm that the product you buy and use contains aspirin at the correct dose. Check the Drug Facts label for \"active ingredients: aspirin\" or \"acetylsalicylic acid\" at the dose that your health professional has prescribed.\nRemember, if you are using aspirin everyday for weeks, months or years to prevent a heart attack, stroke, or for any use not listed on the label — without the guidance from your health professional — you could be doing your body more harm than good.\n\nPDF version (153KB)\nTo learn more, visit Understanding Over-the-Counter Medicine or call toll-free 1-888-INFO-FDA"

        "topic": "OWH Blog Post - Women and Heart Health",
        "content": "Women and Heart Health\n \n\nThe first Friday in February is National Wear Red Day, a day when many people wear red to bring greater attention to heart disease as a leading cause of death for Americans. In fact, 1 in every 5 deaths in women in the United States is caused by heart disease. Celebrate Wear Red Day by learning about heart health, heart disease, and how you can help protect your heart. \nWhat Is Heart Disease?\nHeart disease refers to different types of heart conditions. One example is a heart attack, which happens when plaque or a clot blocks the flow of blood to the heart muscle. Another is coronary artery disease, which occurs when plaque builds up in your arteries. Some people believe that heart disease mainly affects men. But women are just as likely as men to have heart disease.  \nHeart Disease Research and FDA \nWomen’s heart health is important to FDA. Since 1994, FDA’s Office of Women’s Health (OWH) has helped fund research on heart disease in women. This work has provided new insights on heart disease and how different treatments and their effects can vary between men and women. It has also led to knowledge of how certain treatment devices work for women living with heart disease.\n \n\nWhat Are Heart Disease Risk Factors in Women?\nSome risk factors for heart disease may run in families, while others may be due to lifestyle factors. Here are a few common risk factors for heart disease:\n\nDiabetes\nSmoking\nObesity\nMenopause\nHigh cholesterol\nHigh blood pressure\nFamily history of premature heart disease\n\nRead more about common risk factors for heart disease in women.\nWhat Are the Signs of Heart Disease?\nHeart disease is sometimes known as a silent disease and may not be diagnosed until you have other symptoms or emergencies such as a heart attack. Know the signs of a heart attack. For women, signs can be the same or different from those in men.\n\nHeavy ache in your chest or back between your shoulder blades\nSharp pain in your upper body \nShortness of breath\nBreaking out in a cold sweat\nNausea\nUnusual or unexplained tiredness \nFeeling dizzy or light-headed\nFeeling sick to your stomach\n\nIf you have any of the above signs, reach out to a health care provider for medical advice. In the case of a medical emergency, call 9-1-1.\n\nHow Can I Be Heart-Healthy?\n    Learn about heart health. Start by watching this video.\n\n\n\nReduce your risk of heart disease by becoming more aware of your personal risk factors. This can include your age, race or ethnicity, and existing health conditions. Speak to your health care provider about your current medications and risks. Lastly, be sure to manage your existing health conditions well. For instance, having high blood pressure can raise your risk of heart disease.\nTalk to your doctor about aspirin use. Aspirin is not for everyone. You can also get facts about taking aspirin from FDA’s Heart Health fact sheet resource.\nConsider habits that promote good heart health. Aim to maintain a healthy weight. Regular physical activity and eating heart-healthy foods are good ways to start. Use FDA’s Nutrition Facts Label to guide your food choices for good heart health. If you are a current smoker, quitting can be beneficial for your heart health. Learn more with FDA’s booklet on medicines to help you quit smoking.\n \n\nMaternal Heart Health\nEach year, about 700 women in the United States die from problems related to pregnancy, and more than 50,000 women have life-threatening pregnancy complications. Heart conditions are leading causes.\nA few key risk factors for pregnancy-related heart problems include your age, race or ethnicity, and existing health conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. If you plan to get pregnant or are pregnant, talk to your health care provider about your risks and how you can better protect your heart health for you and your baby. Read more on maternal warning signs.\nWomen in Clinical Trials\nClinical trials are research studies that inform the safety of medical treatments and how well they work. Women of all ages, health backgrounds, races, and ethnic backgrounds can volunteer to participate in clinical trials. This can help inform research areas like heart disease. It can also lead to treatments that are safe and work well for all women. Learn how you can take part in a clinical trial.\nThere are several ways to make better heart health decisions today. To start, you can make lifestyle changes that support good heart health. You can also take time to become more informed of your risks. These are just a few steps you can take to live a more heart-healthy life each day.\nRelated links\nCheck out these resources from our office and federal partners: \n\nHow Smoking Affects Heart Health | FDA\nTips for Women to Prevent Heart Disease | FDA\nHigh Blood Pressure | FDA\nCholesterol Medicines Guide | FDA\nInteractive Nutrition Facts Label | FDA\nListen to Your Heart: Women and Heart Disease | NHLBI, NIH\nHeart Disease | HHS Office on Women's Health \nHeart Disease Resources | HHS Office on Women's Health \n\nFor resources and materials on other women's health topics, visit www.fda.gov/womens."

        "topic": "High Blood Pressure--Medicines to Help You",
        "content": "REVISED! High Blood Pressure Medicine Booklet Download, Print and Share\n\n\n\nThere are various FDA-approved products that are currently available to treat high blood pressure. Learn more about your options and use this information to help you talk to your healthcare provider about your blood pressure medicine. You will also find some general information to help you use your medicine wisely.\nHigh blood pressure is a serious illness.\nHigh blood pressure is often called a “silent killer” because you can have it and not know it. You may not feel sick at first. Over time, if you do not get treated for high blood pressure, you can get very sick or even die. \nHigh blood pressure can cause:\n\nKidney failure\nStroke\nBlindness\nHeart attacks\nHeart disease\n\nThere is good news. There are life-saving medicines you can take every day to help control your high blood pressure. If you eat healthy foods, exercise, and take your medicine every day, you can help control your blood pressure.\n\nTake your blood pressure medicine.\nIt is important to take your blood pressure medicine every day. Take your medicine even when your blood pressure comes down... even when you do not feel bad. Do not stop taking your medicine until your healthcare provider says that it is OK.\nMany people who take high blood pressure medicine do not get any side effects. Like all medicines, high blood pressure medicines can sometimes cause side effects. You may have common problems like headaches, dizziness, or an upset stomach. These can be bothersome to how you feel every day but often lessen after the first few weeks of taking the medicine. If you find they continue to be bothersome to you, talk to your healthcare provider.\n\nUnderstanding Your Blood Pressure: What Do the Numbers Mean? \nBlood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is when this force against your artery walls is too high. The higher your blood pressure levels, the more risk you have for other health problems such as heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.\nWhen you have your blood pressure taken, you are told two numbers; for example, 120/80. Both numbers are important. The first (or top) number is your pressure when your heart beats (systolic pressure). The second number is your pressure when your heart relaxes (diastolic pressure). If the measurement reads 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, you would say, “120 over 80.” A normal blood pressure level is usually considered to be less than 120/80.\nTalk with your healthcare provider about your numbers and how you can manage your blood pressure.\nHigh Blood Pressure and Pregnancy\nSome women have high blood pressure during pregnancy. This can put the mother and her baby at risk for problems during the pregnancy and after delivery. High blood pressure sometimes can be severe, which may lead to low birth weight or preterm birth. High blood pressure during pregnancy can raise your risk of high blood pressure in the future.\nThere are different types of high blood pressure during pregnancy.\nGestational hypertension is high blood pressure that you develop while you are pregnant. It starts after you are 20 weeks pregnant. In many cases, gestational hypertension does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. Some women with gestational hypertension develop preeclampsia.\nChronic hypertension is high blood pressure that started before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some women may have had high blood pressure long before becoming pregnant but were unaware until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia. \nPreeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy and may include protein in the urine and very high blood pressure. It usually happens in the last trimester. In rare cases, symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. Preeclampsia may cause damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidneys. Preeclampsia can be serious or even life-threatening for both you and your baby.\nThe most important thing to do is talk with your healthcare provider about any blood pressure problems so you can get the right treatment and control your blood pressure—before you get pregnant. Getting treatment for high blood pressure is important before, during, and after pregnancy to decrease risks to you and your baby.\n\nFor more information about high blood pressure and pregnancy, go to https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/pregnancy.htm.\nTypes of High Blood Pressure Medicines\nYou can use this information to help you talk to your healthcare provider about your blood pressure medicine.\n\nAsk your healthcare provider about the benefits and risks of taking your medicine.

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nMore women die from heart disease than from any other cause: about one in five American women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nYou can take action now to reduce your risk. Resources from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can help women of all ages learn how to use FDA-approved drugs and devices safely to prevent and treat heart disease.\nThe FDA offers fact sheets, videos, and other web-based tools to teach you not only about heart disease but also conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure, which can increase a woman’s heart disease risk.\nThe FDA also offers the Heart Health for Women page to connect women to resources to support heart-healthy living. Watch this FDA Office of Women’s Health educational video to learn more about cardiovascular disease and women’s heart health. The video is part of an initiative to share knowledge and news on women’s health (KNOWH).\n“Many women do not realize that they are at risk for heart disease. Understanding that women may have unique risk factors and can present with non-typical symptoms is critical to fighting heart disease in women,” said Dr. Kaveeta Vasisht, FDA’s associate commissioner for Women’s Health.\nThe risk of heart disease increases for everyone as we age. For women, the risk goes up after menopause, but younger women can also develop heart disease.\nHere are some tips on how to reduce your risk and make informed decisions about your health. Even small changes can help.\n8 Tips to Reduce Your Risk\n1. Know your risk factors. Nine out of 10 women have at least one risk factor for heart disease. Risk factors include:\n\nhigh blood pressure\nhigh cholesterol\ndiabetes\nsmoking\na family history of premature heart disease\n\nObesity also increases the risk of developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and pre-diabetes, which increases the risk of heart disease. With the exception of family history, you can modify the other risk factors to reduce your risk of heart disease.\n2. Manage current health conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Talk to your health care provider to confirm the best treatment plan.\n3. Recognize symptoms of a heart attack in women, and call 9-1-1 if needed. Know that symptoms in women can be the same or different as those in men.\nSymptoms can include:\n\nan ache or feeling of tightness in the chest, arm(s), neck, jaw, back, or abdomen\nshortness of breath\nnausea/vomiting\nlightheadedness\nextreme fatigue\nbreaking out in a cold sweat\n\nAs with men, the most common symptom of a heart attack in women is chest discomfort. But you can have a heart attack without chest pain or pressure. And women are more likely than men to have other symptoms, such as back pain, jaw pain, shortness of breath, indigestion, and nausea/vomiting.\nIf you have these symptoms and suspect you’re having a heart attack, call 9-1-1. Call even if you’re not sure, it could save your life.\n4. Do regular physical activity, and maintain a healthy weight. You don’t need to complete all activity at one set time, and it’s okay if you’re not a fan of the gym.\nWalking may be one easy way to start. Talk to your health care provider about how much activity is right for you.\n5. Make heart-healthy food choices. For example, you can eat fruits and vegetables with each meal; limit saturated fat and added sugars; and eat more whole grains. Choose the leanest cuts of meat available, and prepare them in healthy ways.\nThe updated Nutrition Facts Label can tell you key information about the packaged foods you eat. It includes details about serving sizes and sodium, saturated fat, and added sugar. You can check with your health care provider to confirm the food choices best for you.\n6. Know daily use of aspirin is not right for everyone. Talk with a health care provider before you use aspirin to prevent heart attacks.\n7. If you smoke, try to quit. Check out How Smoking Affects Heart Health and learn more about medicines to help you quit.\n8. Talk to a health care provider about whether you can participate in a clinical trial for a heart medication or procedure. A clinical trial is a research study that involves human volunteers. Visit the FDA’s Women in Clinical Trials page to learn more.\nMenopause and Hormone Therapy\nMenopause does not cause heart disease. But the decline in estrogen after menopause may be one of several factors in the increase in heart disease risk.\nOther risks, such as weight gain, may also increase around the time of menopause.\nHormone therapy can be used to treat some of the problems women have during menopause. However, the FDA has not approved any estrogen hormone replacement therapy for reduction of heart disease. Learn more about menopause and hormones.\nMake a Plan, Take Action\nWork with your health care provider to make a plan for your heart health. No matter what routine you choose, make a list of your medicines and supplements and bring it with you to all your appointments. Talk to your health care provider if you have any questions."

One of these processes is the delivery of oxygen-rich blood to your heart and the rest of your body.\nWhen you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen and deliver it to your heart, which pumps this oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body through the blood vessels. \nBut when you breathe in cigarette smoke, the blood that is distributed to the rest of the body becomes contaminated with the smoke’s chemicals. These chemicals can damage your heart and blood vessels,1 which can lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD)—the leading cause of all deaths in the United States.2\nOrder Free Print Version | Download Infographic\n \n\n\nWhat Cardiovascular Conditions Can Result from Smoking? \nSmoking cigarettes can permanently damage your heart and blood vessels. This can lead to cardiovascular disease.\nCardiovascular disease refers to multiple conditions affecting the heart and/or blood vessels.3 Some of these conditions include:\n\nCoronary heart disease, or the narrowing of blood vessels carrying blood to the heart.\nHypertension (high blood pressure).\nHeart attack.\nStroke.\nAneurysms (a bulge or weakness in an artery).\nPeripheral artery disease.1,2\n\nSmoking cigarettes can also cause CVD by changing your blood chemistry.1,2 \nThese changes in blood chemistry can cause plaque—a waxy substance comprised of cholesterol, scar tissue, calcium, fat, and other material3—to build up in your arteries, the major blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your body. This plaque buildup can lead to a disease called atherosclerosis.\nWhen the chemicals in cigarette smoke cause atherosclerosis and thickened blood in the arteries, it becomes more difficult for blood cells to move through arteries and other blood vessels to get to vital organs like the heart and brain.4 This can create blood clots and ultimately lead to a heart attack or stroke, even death.1,2\nOther rare but serious cardiovascular conditions that can be caused by smoking include:\n\nPeripheral artery disease (and peripheral vascular disease): A condition in which the narrowing of blood vessels results in insufficient blood flow to arms, legs, hands, and feet. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of this condition, which can result in amputation.\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm: A bulge that is formed in an area of the aorta—the main artery that distributes blood through the body—that sits in the abdomen. When an abdominal aortic aneurysm bursts, it can result in sudden death. More women than men die from aortic aneurysms, and nearly all deaths from this condition are caused by smoking.4\n\n\nHow Many People Die Each Year from Cardiovascular Disease Caused by Smoking?\nAccording to the American Heart Association, cardiovascular disease accounts for about 800,000 U.S. deaths every year,5 making it the leading cause of all deaths in the United States. Of those, nearly 20 percent are due to cigarette smoking.2\n\nCan Secondhand Smoke Increase My Risk for Coronary Heart Disease?\nWhile smoking is a direct cause of cardiovascular disease and death, you could be at risk even if you don’t smoke cigarettes. \nPeople who don’t smoke cigarettes but who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke have a 25 to 30 percent increased risk of coronary heart disease than those not exposed.6 \nIn fact, 30,000 U.S. coronary heart disease deaths per year are caused by secondhand smoke.7 Secondhand smoke exposure also increases your risk of having a heart attack or stroke.6,7\n\nCan Quitting Smoking Improve My Heart Health? \nThe best way to safeguard your heart from smoking-related disease and death is to never start using cigarettes. But if you do smoke cigarettes, the earlier you can quit, the better. \nQuitting smoking benefits your heart and cardiovascular system now and in the future:\n\nTwenty minutes after you quit smoking, your heart rate drops.8\nJust 12 hours after quitting smoking, the carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal, allowing more oxygen to vital organs like your heart.8\nWithin four years of quitting, your risk of stroke drops to that of lifetime nonsmokers.9\n\n\nHow Can I Quit Smoking to Protect My Heart? \nAlthough quitting smoking is difficult, it is achievable. \nFDA-approved nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) may be able to help you on your quit journey. NRTs are proven safe and effective to help you quit smoking by delivering measured amounts of nicotine without the toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke.\nMany people who smoke find that FDA-approved NRTs helps them get through the first steps of quitting by reducing cravings and symptoms of withdrawal. \nIf you smoke cigarettes and are concerned about your heart and cardiovascular health, consult with your health care provider about NRTs or other ways to quit to help protect your heart.\n\n\n\nGet Help Quitting\n\n \n\n\n\nHealth Effects of Tobacco Use\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n1.

        "topic": "How AEDs in Public Places Can Restart Hearts",
        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nSudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops pumping blood. It can happen to anyone, at any time, and signs include sudden collapse and immediate loss of consciousness.\nUnlike heart attacks, which are caused by a blockage in an artery to the heart, sudden cardiac arrest is caused when the heart’s electrical system malfunctions. This produces abnormal heart rhythms, called arrhythmias, that make the heart unable to pump blood.\nIf cardiac arrest does occur, rapid treatment with a medical device called an automated external defibrillator (AED) can be lifesaving.\nAn AED is a type of computerized defibrillator that automatically analyzes the heart rhythm in people who are experiencing cardiac arrest. When appropriate, it delivers an electrical shock to the heart to restore its normal rhythm.  The conversion of a ventricular arrhythmia to its normal rhythm by an electrical shock is called defibrillation.\nDefibrillation is time sensitive. The probability of survival decreases by 7% to 10% for every minute that a victim stays in a life-threatening arrhythmia.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates AEDs and their necessary accessories as medical devices and evaluates them for safety and effectiveness before they are marketed.\nMany AEDs Are in Plain Sight\nYou can find AEDs in many public places, including offices, schools, shopping malls, grocery stores, and airports.\nEmergency first-responders are typically equipped with and trained to use AEDs. Some people with underlying cardiac conditions can be at a higher risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Your health care professional can tell you if a home AED is something you should consider.\nHow AEDs Work\nAn AED system includes an AED and its necessary accessories, such as a battery, pad electrodes, and if applicable, an adapter. The AED gives verbal instructions to users.\nThis is how they work:\n\nThe user turns on the AED and follows the voice prompts. Some AEDs turn on automatically when the user opens the lid.\nThe user attaches two sticky pads with sensors (called electrodes) on the chest of the person in cardiac arrest.\nThe electrodes send information about the person’s heart rhythm to a processor in the AED, which then analyzes the rhythm to find out whether an electric shock is needed.\nIf a defibrillation shock is needed, the AED uses the voice prompts to instruct when to press a button to deliver the shock. In some AEDs, the voice prompts announce that a shock is going to be delivered and the AED delivers the shock without intervention by the user.\n\nTraining to Use AEDs\nAEDs are not difficult to use, but training in the use of AEDs is highly recommended. This training, in connection with CPR training, is offered by many major health organizations. Some training is available online.\nClasses can teach you how to recognize the signs of a sudden cardiac arrest, when to call emergency medical services, how to do CPR, and how to use an AED.\nBut as always, in an emergency, call 911 immediately. If you’re somewhere that has an emergency response system that includes a clearly visible number, call that number for assistance. In either case, an operator can give instructions on how you can help someone who has sudden cardiac arrest.\nHow the FDA Regulates AEDs\nThe FDA reviews AEDs and their necessary accessories, such as batteries and pad electrodes, for safety and effectiveness. As part of its regulatory oversight, the FDA closely monitors reports of device malfunctions, and reviews such reports from consumers and manufacturers of AEDs.\nAlthough the FDA regulates AEDs as medical devices, it does not regulate the resuscitation guidelines for the use of these devices. Visit this American Red Cross website to learn how and when to use an AED.\nThe FDA maintains a list of FDA-approved AEDs and FDA-approved AED accessories. Certain AEDs that do not appear on the FDA-approved list are considered “legacy devices.” Although some of these legacy devices are still in use, they may no longer be legally marketed.\nIf you own an AED system, check to make sure your AED and its accessories are FDA approved. Contact the AED manufacturer with any questions or concerns. For more information, please visit the FDA webpage, Automated External Defibrillators.\nGiven the importance of these devices in emergency situations, the FDA recommends you continue to keep such legacy AEDs available for use until you receive an FDA-approved AED.  If a cardiac arrest emergency happens and an AED is available, know that AEDs, even those considered legacy devices, can save lives.\nThe potential lifesaving benefits of FDA-approved AEDs when used as intended outweigh the probable risks of using them, when accompanied by adequate directions and appropriate warnings. You should be confident in using these devices in life-threatening situations\nReport Device Problems to the FDA\nHealth care professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program:\n\nComplete and submit the report online.\nDownload the form or call 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form, then complete and return to the address on the form, or submit by fax to 1-800-FDA-0178.\n\nIf you have questions about an AED device or AED accessory, contact the manufacturer. You can also call the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator who works with your state; phone numbers are listed online."

Enséñeles a las mujeres en su familia y en su comunidad cómo prevenir y tratar la infección por el VIH.\n¿Qué es el VIH?\nEl VIH es el virus que causa el SIDA. Si una persona tiene el VIH se dice que es VIH positiva (VIH+).\nEl VIH hace que sea más difícil para el organismo combatir las enfermedades.\n\n¿Cómo se contrae el VIH?\nEl VIH se propaga a través de los líquidos corporales como la sangre, el semen o la leche materna.\nUna persona puede contraer el VIH cuando:\n\nTiene relaciones sexuales con una persona VIH+ y no usa un condón o preservativo.\nComparte agujas o jeringas (para inyectarse drogas) con una persona con el VIH.\nRecibe sangre de una persona que tiene el VIH. Hoy en día, toda la sangre donada se analiza para detectar si tiene el VIH. No es posible contraer el VIH por donar sangre.\n\nLa mayoría de las mujeres contraen el VIH por tener relaciones sexuales sin protección con los hombres. Use siempre un condón cuando tenga relaciones sexuales.\nNo se puede contraer el VIH por dar la mano, besar o compartir utensilios de la casa como tenedores o vasos con una persona con el VIH.\n\n¿Cómo se sabe si una persona tiene el VIH?\nLa única manera de saber con certeza es haciendo la prueba del VIH.\n\nNo se puede saber si una persona tiene el VIH con solo mirarla.La mayoría de las personas no muestran signos externos cuando acaban de contraer el VIH.\nUna persona puede propagar el VIH aun cuando no parezca que está enferma.\n\n¿Cuáles son las pruebas para detectar el VIH?\nHay tres tipos básicos de pruebas para detectar el VIH:\n\nSangre: se toma una pequeña muestra de sangre del dedo o del brazo.\nOral: se toma una muestra de líquido del interior de la boca.\nOrina: se usa una pequeña muestra de orina.\n\nPara obtener los resultados de laboratorio de algunas pruebas del VIH hay que esperar entre 1 y 2 semanas. Con otras pruebas conocidas como “pruebas rápidas del VIH” se pueden obtener los resultados en 20 minutos aproximadamente.\nUsted puede hacer una prueba en el consultorio del médico, en las unidades móviles de salud o en las ferias de salud. También hay pruebas del VIH caseras que puede hacerse usted misma.\nPara encontrar un sitio cerca a usted donde pueda hacerse la prueba:\n\nLlame al 1-800-232-4636\nEnvíe un texto con el código postal a KNOWIT (566948)\n\n¿Qué es el “período silente”?\nEs posible que durante semanas o meses el VIH no salga en las pruebas. Este lapso se conoce como “período silente”.\n\nEs posible que la prueba del VIH de una persona que lo ha contraído recientemente no de un resultado positivo aunque tenga el virus.\nUna persona puede trasmitir el virus a otros durante el período silente.\n\n\n¿Hay una cura para el VIH?\nEl VIH no tiene cura. Hay medicamentos que pueden tomar las personas con el VIH para ayudar a que no se acumule el virus en el organismo.\n\nLas personas con el VIH tal vez necesiten tomar tres o más medicamentos al día.\nCon el tiempo, si las personas no toman los medicamentos para el VIH pueden enfermarme gravemente.\nLas personas con el VIH no deben dejar de tomar sus medicamentos sin consultar primero con el médico.\n\nLa FDA ha autorizado además un medicamento que algunas personas pueden tomar para reducir su riesgo de contraer el VIH.\n\n¿Qué deben saber las mujeres embarazadas acerca del VIH?\nUna mujer puede trasmitir el VIH a su bebé durante el embarazo, el trabajo de parto o el parto. Puede también trasmitírselo durante la lactancia materna.\n\nLas mujeres con el VIH deben consultar con el médico antes de quedar embarazadas.\nLas mujeres con el VIH pueden tomar medicamentos para reducir la probabilidad de trasmitirle el virus al bebé.\nAlgunos medicamentos para el VIH no deben tomarse durante el embarazo porque pueden causar defectos congénitos.\n\nPara recibir un folleto gratuito sobre los medicamentos para el VIH y otros materiales relacionados con la salud de la mujer, visite: www.fda.gov/womens\n\nPara información adicional:\nSitio web sobre el VIH/SIDA del gobierno federal de los Estados Unidos\nAIDS.gov\nAIDSinfo/infoSIDA\nwww.aidsinfo.nih.gov\nhttp://infosida.nih.gov\nLínea Directa Nacional del SIDA, Centro para el Control y la Pevención de Enfermedades (CDC)\n1-800-342-2437\nRecursos para usted\n\nHIV and AIDS: Medicines to Help You\nWomen and HIV"

There are medicines that can treat HIV and help people live longer.\nUse this page to help you talk to your healthcare provider about the medicines you are taking. This information provides some basic facts about the anti-HIV medicines that have been approved by the FDA.\nHelpful Tips\n\nQuick Facts\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor\nRisks and Side Effects\nHIV Prevention: Medicine to Reduce HIV Risk\nPregnancy Registries\n\nTypes of HIV Drugs\n\nCombination Medicines \nNucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)\nNonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nProtease Inhibitors\nIntegrase Inhibitors\nFusion Inhibitors\nCCR5 Antagonists\nCD4 Post-Attachment Inhibitor\nCYP3A Inhibitors\n\n\nQuick Facts\nThere is a lot you need to know about HIV. Read these quick facts before you talk with your healthcare provider about your HIV treatment.\n\nHIV is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus.\nHIV makes it hard for your body to fight off sickness. \nThere are cells in your blood called “CD4 cells” or “T cells.” These cells help protect your body from disease. HIV kills these cells.\nThere are medicines that you can take to reduce the amount of HIV and increase the CD4 cells in your body.\nThese medicines do not cure HIV, but can help you live a longer, healthier life. These medicines also lower the risk of giving HIV to someone else. \nThe medicines used to treat HIV are called “antiretroviral treatment,” or ART. There are different kinds of ART medicines.\nWhen you are on ART for HIV, you need to take medicine every day. You may need to take 1 or more pills every day. Some ART medicines come in a liquid you take by mouth or as an intravenous, or IV, infusion your healthcare provider can give to you. The combination of different HIV medicines that you take is called your regimen.\nIt is important that you take your medicines every day. Do not skip doses or stop taking your medicines without first talking to your healthcare provider. Over time, you can get sick if you do not take your medicines.\nYou should not breastfeed if you are HIV-positive because HIV can be passed to your baby through breast milk.\nSome medicines may reduce how well some hormonal birth control works. Patients who could become pregnant should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and what medicines are best for them.\nBefore taking any new ART medicine, tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.\nIf you are HIV-positive and pregnant, you can lower the chance of passing HIV to your unborn baby by taking ART. \n\t\nSome HIV medicines should not be taken at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy because they may harm your unborn baby.\nSome HIV medicines should not be taken at all during pregnancy. You may not have enough of certain HIV medicines in your body because of changes to your body that occur during pregnancy.\n\n\nSome people with HIV may have changes in body fat, such as fat build-up in the belly, neck, or breasts or fat loss in the arms, legs, buttocks, or face. Some people with HIV will never have these changes.  The exact cause is not known. It may be caused by HIV infection or medicines to treat HIV.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Do not start a new medicine or stop taking a medicine without telling your healthcare provider.\n\nSkip to HIV Medicines\n\nImportant Questions to Ask Your Doctor\nAsk your doctor to tell you what you should know about your HIV medicines.\n\nWhat medicines am I taking to treat HIV?\nWhen should I take each medicine?\nShould I take my medicines with food?\nWhich prescription medicines, herbs (like St. John’s Wort), over-the-counter medicines (like antacids), or vitamins can affect my HIV medicines? Can my HIV medicines affect any of the other medicines I take?\nHow should I store my HIV medicines? What about when I am away from home or go out of town?\nWhat are the side effects of the medicines I am taking?\nWhat should I do if I start having bad side effects?\n\nSkip to HIV Medicines\n\nRisks and Side Effects\nHIV medicines can sometimes cause side effects. Some side effects happen for a short time. Other side effects can cause long term health problems. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effects you are having. Do not stop taking your medicine without first talking to your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may tell you tips to help you cope with the side effects. Your healthcare provider may also tell you to take different medicines.\n\nThis page does not give the specific side effects and warnings for each HIV medicine.\nTalk to your healthcare provider about the side effects and warnings for the medicines you take.\nCheck the FDA Web site to find more HIV medicine information.\n\nSkip to HIV Medicines\nMy Regimen\nIt is important that you take your HIV medicines just as your healthcare provider tells you. Your medicines may not work if you skip a dose or do not stick to your schedule. Over time, you can get sick if you do not take your medicines as directed. Your HIV may become resistant to your medicines. This means your medicines could stop working and more HIV could build up in your body.\nHere are some tips to help you remember when to take your HIV medicines.\n\nUse a schedule or planner.\nSet the alarm on your watch or phone.\nUse a pillbox to help you organize your pills.\nAsk a friend or family member to help you.\n\nChart to help you remember when to take your HIV medicine\n\n\n\n\nTime\nMedicine Name\nDose\n\t\t\t(How many Pills)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n6:30\nxxxxx (example)\n1 Pill\nTake by mouth with food\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nOrder or Download our Free Medicine Record Keeper.\n\nGo Back to the Top\n\nCombination Medicines\nCombination medicines include two or more different HIV medicines in one pill.

Burlington, MA: Jones-Bartlett Learning, 2023.\nTell your doctor, health care provider, or pharmacist if you:\n\nSmoke.\nHave liver disease.\nHave blood clots or family members who have had blood clots.\nHave had a stroke or heart attack or have vascular disease.\nHave migraines.\nAre taking any other medicines, like antibiotics or daily prescription medicines.\nAre taking any herbal products, like St. John’s Wort.\nAre breastfeeding.\nHave been pregnant or recently given birth.\nHave abnormal uterine bleeding.\nHave breast cancer.\n\nTo avoid pregnancy:\n\nNo matter which contraceptive you choose, it is important to follow all of the directions carefully. If you do not, you increase your chance of getting pregnant.\nThe best way to avoid pregnancy is to not have sex.\n\n\n\nPermanent sterilization\nSterilization surgery for women (also called trans-abdominal surgical sterilization)\nSterilization surgery is for women who are sure they never want to have a child or do not want any more children. Sterilization surgery may not be right for you if you are uncertain about not having children or having any more children. Sometimes it is possible to reverse the sterilization. Reversal involves another surgery that might not be successful. \n \n\nWhat is it?\n\nThis is a surgery a woman needs only once.\nIt is permanent.\nOne way is by tying and cutting the fallopian tubes — this is called tubal ligation.\nThe fallopian tubes also can be sealed using an instrument with an electrical current.\nThey also can be closed with clips, clamps, or rings.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe fallopian tubes are blocked so the egg and sperm cannot meet in the fallopian tube. This stops you from getting pregnant.\n\nHow do I get it?\n\nThis is surgery.\nYou will need general anesthesia.\n\nChance of getting pregnant with use (number of pregnancies expected in one year per 100 women who use this method of contraception)\n\nOut of 100 women who use have this surgery, less than 1 may get pregnant.\n\nSome risks\n\nBleeding\nInfection or other complications after surgery\nPain\n\n\nDoes it provide protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? No. \n\n\nSterilization surgery for men (vasectomy)\nSterilization surgery is for men who are sure they never want to have a child or do not want any more children. Vasectomy may not be right for you if you are uncertain about not having children or having any more children. Sometimes it is possible to reverse the operation, but the likelihood of a successful reversal decreases as more time passes between vasectomy and reversal. Reversal involves complicated surgery that might not work.\n \n\nWhat is it?\n\nThis is a surgery a man needs only once.\nIt is permanent.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe surgery blocks a man’s vas deferens (the tubes that carry sperm from the testes).\nAfter this surgery, the semen (the fluid that comes out of a man’s penis) has no sperm in it.\nIt takes about three months to clear sperm out of a man’s system. You will need to use another form of birth control until a test shows there is no longer any sperm in the seminal fluid.\n\nHow do I get it?\n\nThis is surgery.\nLocal anesthesia is used.\n\nChance of getting pregnant with use (number of pregnancies expected in one year per 100 women whose partner uses this method of contraception)\n\nOut of 100 women whose partner has had a vasectomy, less than 1 may get pregnant.\n\nSome risks\n\nBleeding\nInfection\nPain\n\nThe success of reversal surgery depends on:\n\nThe length of time since the vasectomy was performed.\nWhether or not antibodies to sperm have developed.\nThe surgical method used for vasectomy.\nThe length and location of the segments of vas deferens that were removed or blocked.\n\n\nDoes it provide protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? No.\n\n\nLong-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC)\nThese contraceptives last for several years. If you want to get pregnant, you can stop using them at any time. A health care professional removes a LARC so you can get pregnant. \n\n\nIUD or IUS (intrauterine device or intrauterine system) without hormone (copper)\n \n\nWhat is it? \n\nA T-shaped device containing copper put into the uterus by a health care provider\n\nHow does it work? \n\nThe IUD prevents sperm from reaching the egg, from fertilizing the egg, and may prevent the egg from attaching (implanting) in the womb (uterus).\nIt does not stop the ovaries from making an egg (ovulating) each month.\nThe IUD can be used for up to 10 years.\nAfter the IUD is taken out, it is possible to get pregnant.\n\nHow do I get it?\n\nAn IUD is put into the uterus by a health care provider.\n\nChance of getting pregnant with use (number of pregnancies expected per 100 women who use this method of contraception for one year)\n\nOut of 100 women who use this contraceptive, less than 1 may get pregnant.\n\nSome side effects\n\nCramps\nHeavier, longer periods, or spotting between periods\n\nSome less common risks\n\nEctopic pregnancy (a pregnancy outside of the uterus) \nExpulsion - the IUD is no longer in the uterus and therefore there is no pregnancy protection\nPelvic inflammatory disease\nSevere infection\nUterine perforation\n\nDoes it provide protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? No.\n\n\n IUD or IUS with hormone (progestin)\n \n\nWhat is it?\n\n\n\n\nA T-shaped device containing a progestin put into the uterus by a health care provider\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\nIt thickens the mucus of your cervix, which makes it harder for sperm to get to the egg, and also thins the lining of your uterus.\nThe IUD can last for 8 years or more, depending on the type. \nAfter the IUD is taken out, it is possible to get pregnant. \n\nHow do I get it?\n\nAn IUD is put into your uterus by a health care provider. \n\nChance of getting pregnant with use (number of pregnancies expected per 100 women who use this method of contraception for one year)\n\n\nOut of 100 women who use this contraceptive, less than 1 may get pregnant.\n\n\nSome side effects \n\nAbdominal/pelvic pain\nIrregular bleeding \nNo periods (amenorrhea)\n\nSome less common risks \n\nEctopic pregnancy \nExpulsion - the IUD is no longer in the uterus and therefore there is no pregnancy protection\nOvarian cysts\nPelvic inflammatory disease \nSevere infection \nUterine perforation\n\nDoes it provide protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?

        "topic": "FDA approves first injectable treatment for HIV pre-exposure prevention",
        "content": "For Immediate Release:\nDecember 20, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Apretude (cabotegravir extended-release injectable suspension) for use in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 pounds) for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV. Apretude is given first as two initiation injections administered one month apart, and then every two months thereafter. Patients can either start their treatment with Apretude or take oral cabotegravir (Vocabria) for four weeks to assess how well they tolerate the drug. \n“Today’s approval adds an important tool in the effort to end the HIV epidemic by providing the first option to prevent HIV that does not involve taking a daily pill,” said Debra Birnkrant, M.D., director of the Division of Antivirals in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “This injection, given every two months, will be critical to addressing the HIV epidemic in the U.S., including helping high-risk individuals and certain groups where adherence to daily medication has been a major challenge or not a realistic option.”\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, notable gains have been made in increasing PrEP use for HIV prevention in the U.S. and preliminary data show that in 2020, about 25% of the 1.2 million people for whom PrEP is recommended were prescribed it, compared to only about 3% in 2015. However, there remains significant room for improvement. PrEP requires high levels of adherence to be effective and certain high-risk individuals and groups, such as young men who have sex with men, are less likely to adhere to daily medication. Other interpersonal factors, such as substance use disorders, depression, poverty and efforts to conceal medication also can impact adherence. It is hoped that the availability of a long-acting injectable PrEP option will increase PrEP uptake and adherence in these groups.\nThe safety and efficacy of Apretude to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV were evaluated in two randomized, double-blind trials that compared Apretude to Truvada, a once daily oral medication for HIV PrEP. Trial 1 included HIV-uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men and have high-risk behavior for HIV infection. Trial 2 included uninfected cisgender women at risk of acquiring HIV.\nParticipants who took Apretude started the trial with cabotegravir (oral, 30 mg tablet) and a placebo daily for up to five weeks, followed by Apretude 600mg injection at months one and two, then every two months thereafter and a daily placebo tablet.\nParticipants who took Truvada started the trial taking oral Truvada and placebo daily for up to five weeks, followed by oral Truvada daily and placebo intramuscular injection at months one and two and every two months thereafter.\nIn Trial 1, 4,566 cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men received either Apretude or Truvada. The trial measured the rate of HIV infections among trial participants taking daily cabotegravir followed by Apretude injections every two months compared to daily oral Truvada. The trial showed participants who took Apretude had 69% less risk of getting infected with HIV when compared to participants who took Truvada.\nIn Trial 2, 3,224 cisgender women received either Apretude or Truvada. The trial measured the rate of HIV infections in participants who took oral cabotegravir and injections of Apretude compared to those who took Truvada orally. The trial showed participants who took Apretude had 90% less risk of getting infected with HIV when compared to participants who took Truvada.\nSide effects occurring more frequently in participants who received Apretude compared to participants who received Truvada in either trial include injection site reactions, headache, pyrexia (fever), fatigue, back pain, myalgia and rash.\nApretude includes a boxed warning to not use the drug unless a negative HIV test is confirmed. It must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to starting the drug and before each injection to reduce the risk of developing drug resistance. Drug-resistant HIV variants have been identified in people with undiagnosed HIV when they use Apretude for HIV PrEeP. Individuals who become infected with HIV while receiving Apretude for PrEP must transition to a complete HIV treatment regimen. The drug labeling also includes warnings and precautions regarding hypersensitivity reactions, hepatotoxicity (liver damage) and depressive disorders.\nApretude was granted a Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation. The FDA granted the approval of Apretude to Viiv.\nRelated Information\n\nRelated Information\n\nFDA: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\nHIV Treatment\n\n\n\n###\n\n\nBoilerplate\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

        "content": "Listen (MP3, 27MB)\n\n\nIn this episode, we'll be talking about the use of medication regimens known as PrEP and PEP as part of HIV prevention strategies for older adults with Dr. Debra Birnkrant, MD, Director, Division of Antivirals, Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research (CDER).\n\n\n\n\nHealth Equity Forum Podcast: Episode 5 - Transcript\nRADM Araojo: Hello, and welcome to The Health Equity Forum Podcast, hosted by the FDA Office of Minority Health and Health Equity. I'm your host, Rear Admiral Richardae Araojo, the Associate Commissioner for Minority Health and Director of the Office of Minority Health and Health Equity at FDA. In this episode, we'll be talking about the use of medication regimens known as PrEP and PEP as part of HIV prevention strategies for older adults.\nHIV is not only a disease of young people. According to the most recent data from 2018, almost 1 in 6 new diagnoses of HIV were in people age 50 and over. African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos had the highest HIV incidence among this group. Like everyone else, older adults can acquire HIV from having unprotected sex with someone living with HIV, through contact with HIV infected blood, or by sharing needles with the person living with HIV. For those at high risk of HIV infection through sex or injection drug use, PrEP and PEP are medication regimens that can greatly reduce their risk of transmission. In 2019, the US Department of Health and Human Services embarked upon a bold initiative called Ending The HIV Epidemic in The United States. This initiative aims to reduce the number of new HIV infections in the United States by 75% by 2025, and then by at least 90% by 2030 for an estimated 250,000 total HIV infections averted.\nBoth younger and older Americans alike are at risk of HIV infection. So it's important for everyone to be aware of how to protect themselves. To talk about the use of PrEP and PEP for HIV prevention among older adults. I'd like to welcome Dr. Debra Birnkrant, Director of the Division of Antivirals and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at FDA. Welcome Dr. Birnkrant.\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Thank you for having me Rear Admiral Araojo.\nRADM Araojo: Dr. Birnkrant, what is your role as the Director of the Division of Antivirals? And can you describe the work of your division?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Our division is part of the Office of Infectious Diseases in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at FDA. We review all applications for antiviral drug products.\nRADM Araojo: Why don't we start by providing listeners a brief explanation of what HIV is?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Sure. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It's a retrovirus that infects immune cells and impairs the body's ability to protect itself against other infections or cancer. If left untreated, HIV usually progresses to AIDS, which stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS is a devastating, life-threatening condition that causes serious damage to the body's immune system. There is no cure for HIV, but progress in the treatment and prevention of HIV has advanced significantly since AIDS was first documented in 1981. We now have medications to treat HIV called Antiretroviral Therapy or A-R-T. These work to decrease the amount of HIV in the body, which helps prevent the damage that can be caused by HIV and keep HIV infection from progressing to AIDS. People living with HIV can live longer, healthier lives when they maintain their antiretroviral treatment regimen.\nRADM Araojo: Why is HIV prevention important for older adults?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Well, although we've come a long way, HIV is still a major public health problem. Over 1 million Americans are living with HIV and nearly half of those are age 50 and over. This may be attributable to the fact that people with HIV are living longer, thanks to Antiretroviral Therapy. But we also have a significant number of new diagnoses of HIV in older adults. This may be because older adults don't perceive themselves to be at high risk for HIV infection, as it has historically been viewed as a disease of young people. But if they are staying sexually active and engaging in high risk sexual activities or injection drug use, older adults have the same risk for becoming infected with HIV as their younger peers.\nFor instance, when consistently and correctly used, condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV infection due to sex. However, some post-menopausal women may not feel the need to use a condom with their male partners because they know they cannot become pregnant. Also, some older adults may not be as aware of the risk factors for HIV or how to protect themselves as younger people if they are new to the dating scene, because of a divorce or death of a longtime partner.\nSo older adults are still vulnerable to HIV infection. And unfortunately, HIV testing rates among adults over 50 are very low. Older adults should get tested to know their HIV status if they are sexually active, outside the monogamous relationship or inject drugs, even if they have no symptoms. Some older adults notice symptoms of HIV, but don't get tested as they assume common symptoms like fatigue and weight loss are part of the aging process. When it's not caught early, HIV infection can progress further and be more difficult to treat. There's also the issue of stigma associated with HIV and AIDS that may be stronger in older generations. Stigma negatively affects a person's quality of life, their self-image, and their ability to adopt healthy behaviors. So even though older adults may visit with their healthcare providers more often, they may be uncomfortable discussing their sex lives. And, if a healthcare provider doesn't routinely ask their older patients about these risk factors, high risk patients may remain unaware of the need to get tested for HIV and prevention options like PrEP and PEP.\nRADM Araojo: And what is PrEP and PEP?\nDr, Debra Birnkrant: PrEP and PEP are medications that HIV negative people can take to prevent HIV infection. PrEP stands for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis. Right now, PrEP is a pill you take every day before possible exposure to HIV to prevent you from getting HIV from unprotected sex. PEP, which stands for Post-exposure Prophylaxis is a series of pills you take for emergency prevention of HIV after a single high risk exposure. Some situations that would warrant the use of PEP are unprotected sex with someone who is HIV positive or who's HIV status is unknown. Sexual assault and sharing needles, or using other equipment to inject drugs with someone who may have HIV.\nRADM Araojo: Okay. So let's focus on PrEP first. Can you tell us more about its use?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Currently approved PrEP options are a combination antiretroviral medications consisting of tenofovir and emtricitabine, that are commonly used to stop HIV from replicating and people who are already infected. However, if taken daily in people who are HIV negative, the presence of these medicines in the bloodstream can usually stop the virus from establishing itself in the body and spreading following an HIV exposure. So the individual remains HIV negative. It's not a vaccine though. Vaccines train the body's immune system to fight off viruses for years. PrEP only works if you take it every day to keep enough of the medication in your bloodstream to block the virus. There are a couple of different medications approved for PrEP on the market right now. The difference has to do with the type of tenofovir included in the medication. It is important to discuss with your healthcare provider about which PrEP medication is right for you.\nRADM Araojo: Who should consider using PrEP?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: PrEP is for individuals who have been tested and found to be HIV negative, but who may be at substantial risk of becoming infected through sex. The types of sexual activities that are at highest risk are anal and vaginal sex. If you are HIV negative, but have engaged in anal or vaginal sex in the past six months and your sexual partner is living with HIV or is at risk of HIV infection because they have sex with multiple partners for instance, PrEP may benefit you. People who have sexually transmitted diseases are also more likely to get HIV. So consider PrEP if you have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease in the past six months, or do not regularly use condoms.\nRADM Araojo: And how effective is PrEP?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Studies show that PrEP lowers the chances of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken daily. While we do not know for sure how long you need to take PrEP before you reach maximal protection, the CDC recommends you should take PrEP for about seven days to reach maximum protection from HIV infection if you have anal sex and for 21 days for maximum protection, if you have vaginal sex.\nRADM Araojo: That's a significant reduction in risk. How can someone obtain PrEP?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Well, you will need a prescription from your healthcare provider. There is also an online tool called preplocator.org that you can use to find a healthcare provider in your area who can prescribe PrEP. Your provider will want you to come in for an appointment to discuss your risk of HIV infection. If they agree that you are a good candidate for PrEP, they'll want to conduct a general physical exam and do an HIV test to make sure you are HIV negative. You will also be tested to see if your kidneys and liver are functioning well. Then once you are prescribed PrEP, be prepared for regular follow up appointments so your healthcare provider can monitor how your body is reacting to PrEP and check your HIV status to make sure you remain HIV negative.\nRADM Araojo: Let's talk about PEP. When should a person start taking PEP?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: PEP should be taken within three days of a possible exposure to HIV. The sooner PEP is started after a possible HIV exposure, the better. Keep in mind that PEP is for a single, one-time HIV exposure. It shouldn't be used in place of other HIV prevention methods, by people who may be exposed to HIV repeatedly.\nRADM Araojo: And how effective is PEP?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Well like PrEP, PEP is also a combination of antiretroviral drugs that can help prevent HIV from spreading in the body if taken within the 72 hour window from the time of exposure. While taking PEP, it's important to keep using other HIV prevention methods such as condoms. Once started, the use of a PEP regimen is 28 days. It's believed to be more than 80% effective as long as a patient completes the full course by taking the medication every day and avoids additional exposures to HIV.\nRADM Araojo: And how can someone obtain PEP?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Talk to your healthcare provider, an emergency room doctor, or an urgent healthcare provider about PEP right away if you think you've been exposed to HIV. They'll determine your level of risk and whether a prescription for PEP makes sense for you.\nRADM Araojo: Are there any side effects for PrEP or PEP consumers should know about?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: The most common side effects observed with PrEP and PEP are mild to moderate gastrointestinal effects like nausea or upset stomach, fatigue or headache. These side effects usually go away over time and most people don't have to change or stop taking their medication.\nRADM Araojo: What kinds of questions should older adults ask their healthcare provider when discussing the use of PrEP or PEP for HIV prevention?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Well, it's always important to discuss any other medications you are taking with your healthcare provider before starting a new prescription, particularly for older adults who may be taking multiple medications each day. And don't forget to discuss over the counter medications like herbs, vitamins, supplements, and any other drugs you may take to avoid any potential interactions with PrEP or PEP. Likewise, ask your healthcare provider whether PrEP or PEP is a good choice for you considering any current medical conditions you may have. And some other good questions to ask are how to manage my side effects, should you experience them, how to remind yourself to take your medication each day, and what to do if you miss a dose. Also, keep in mind that while PEP has given for a limited duration of 28 days, PrEP should be taken for as long as you remain at risk of HIV. However, PrEP doesn't have to be a lifelong treatment. Discuss with your doctor if you feel your risk of HIV has changed and whether it is safe to stop PrEP. Do not stop PEP or PrEP without first discussing with your doctor.\nRADM Araojo: Can you talk more about the possible side effects of long-term PrEP use?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Tenofovir, one of the main ingredients of currently approved PrEP is associated with a small risk of decreased kidney function and or bone density loss. You might also experience some minor weight changes and changes to your blood cholesterol levels, depending on which PrEP medication you are prescribed. Your doctor will need to determine if you're a good candidate for PrEP based on your lab test results and medical history. And will monitor you for these potential issues while you remain on PrEP.\nRADM Araojo: Where can consumers get more information or resources?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: They can visit hiv.gov for more information on HIV prevention options. This is where you'll find the HIV services locator I mentioned earlier, preplocator.org. Another good resource is the CDCs campaign, Let's Stop HIV Together, aimed at stopping HIV stigma and promoting HIV testing, prevention and treatment.\nRADM Araojo: And finally, is there anything else you would like our listeners to know?\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: I want to emphasize that neither PrEP nor PEP is a cure for HIV or AIDS, and neither is 100% effective at preventing HIV infection. They also don't work against other sexually transmitted diseases. To get the most protection during sex while using PrEP or PEP, always use a condom. It's a good idea to talk with your doctor and learn about safer sex practices, no matter what your age. And avoid sharing needles or any other equipment use to inject drugs. Always use new sterile needles for injection. The best way for us to reduce the spread of HIV is through routine screening, get tested to know your HIV status and ask your partners to do the same. You may also be at higher risk if you or your partner had a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985 in the United States, or a blood transfusion in a developing country at any time. If you have ever been diagnosed with or treated for hepatitis or tuberculosis, your risk of HIV may be higher as well.\nRADM Araojo: Dr. Birnkrant, thank you so much for joining me today to discuss PrEP and PEP use among older adults for HIV prevention and for sharing such valuable information with our listeners.\nDr. Debra Birnkrant: Thanks for having me.\nRADM Araojo: For more information about the Health Equity Forum Podcast series, visit our website at www.fda.gov/healthequity.

There are medicines that can treat HIV and help people live longer.\nUse this page to help you talk to your healthcare provider about the medicines you are taking. This information provides some basic facts about the anti-HIV medicines that have been approved by the FDA.\nHelpful Tips\n\nQuick Facts\nQuestions to Ask Your Doctor\nRisks and Side Effects\nHIV Prevention: Medicine to Reduce HIV Risk\nPregnancy Registries\n\nTypes of HIV Drugs\n\nCombination Medicines \nNucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)\nNonnucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)\nProtease Inhibitors\nIntegrase Inhibitors\nFusion Inhibitors\nCCR5 Antagonists\nCD4 Post-Attachment Inhibitor\nCYP3A Inhibitors\n\n\nQuick Facts\nThere is a lot you need to know about HIV. Read these quick facts before you talk with your healthcare provider about your HIV treatment.\n\nHIV is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus.\nHIV makes it hard for your body to fight off sickness. \nThere are cells in your blood called “CD4 cells” or “T cells.” These cells help protect your body from disease. HIV kills these cells.\nThere are medicines that you can take to reduce the amount of HIV and increase the CD4 cells in your body.\nThese medicines do not cure HIV, but can help you live a longer, healthier life. These medicines also lower the risk of giving HIV to someone else. \nThe medicines used to treat HIV are called “antiretroviral treatment,” or ART. There are different kinds of ART medicines.\nWhen you are on ART for HIV, you need to take medicine every day. You may need to take 1 or more pills every day. Some ART medicines come in a liquid you take by mouth or as an intravenous, or IV, infusion your healthcare provider can give to you. The combination of different HIV medicines that you take is called your regimen.\nIt is important that you take your medicines every day. Do not skip doses or stop taking your medicines without first talking to your healthcare provider. Over time, you can get sick if you do not take your medicines.\nYou should not breastfeed if you are HIV-positive because HIV can be passed to your baby through breast milk.\nSome medicines may reduce how well some hormonal birth control works. Patients who could become pregnant should talk to their healthcare provider about birth control and what medicines are best for them.\nBefore taking any new ART medicine, tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.\nIf you are HIV-positive and pregnant, you can lower the chance of passing HIV to your unborn baby by taking ART. \n\t\nSome HIV medicines should not be taken at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy because they may harm your unborn baby.\nSome HIV medicines should not be taken at all during pregnancy. You may not have enough of certain HIV medicines in your body because of changes to your body that occur during pregnancy.\n\n\nSome people with HIV may have changes in body fat, such as fat build-up in the belly, neck, or breasts or fat loss in the arms, legs, buttocks, or face. Some people with HIV will never have these changes.  The exact cause is not known. It may be caused by HIV infection or medicines to treat HIV.\nTell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Do not start a new medicine or stop taking a medicine without telling your healthcare provider.\n\nSkip to HIV Medicines\n\nImportant Questions to Ask Your Doctor\nAsk your doctor to tell you what you should know about your HIV medicines.\n\nWhat medicines am I taking to treat HIV?\nWhen should I take each medicine?\nShould I take my medicines with food?\nWhich prescription medicines, herbs (like St. John’s Wort), over-the-counter medicines (like antacids), or vitamins can affect my HIV medicines? Can my HIV medicines affect any of the other medicines I take?\nHow should I store my HIV medicines? What about when I am away from home or go out of town?\nWhat are the side effects of the medicines I am taking?\nWhat should I do if I start having bad side effects?\n\nSkip to HIV Medicines\n\nRisks and Side Effects\nHIV medicines can sometimes cause side effects. Some side effects happen for a short time. Other side effects can cause long term health problems. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effects you are having. Do not stop taking your medicine without first talking to your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may tell you tips to help you cope with the side effects. Your healthcare provider may also tell you to take different medicines.\n\nThis page does not give the specific side effects and warnings for each HIV medicine.\nTalk to your healthcare provider about the side effects and warnings for the medicines you take.\nCheck the FDA Web site to find more HIV medicine information.\n\nSkip to HIV Medicines\nMy Regimen\nIt is important that you take your HIV medicines just as your healthcare provider tells you. Your medicines may not work if you skip a dose or do not stick to your schedule. Over time, you can get sick if you do not take your medicines as directed. Your HIV may become resistant to your medicines. This means your medicines could stop working and more HIV could build up in your body.\nHere are some tips to help you remember when to take your HIV medicines.\n\nUse a schedule or planner.\nSet the alarm on your watch or phone.\nUse a pillbox to help you organize your pills.\nAsk a friend or family member to help you.\n\nChart to help you remember when to take your HIV medicine\n\n\n\n\nTime\nMedicine Name\nDose\n\t\t\t(How many Pills)\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n6:30\nxxxxx (example)\n1 Pill\nTake by mouth with food\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nOrder or Download our Free Medicine Record Keeper.\n\nGo Back to the Top\n\nCombination Medicines\nCombination medicines include two or more different HIV medicines in one pill.

If left untreated, HIV can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), an advanced stage of HIV infection. There is no cure for HIV, but HIV prevention and treatment options are available.\nWho is affected by HIV?\nIn the United States, an estimated 1.1 million people are living with HIV. African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos account for 2 out of 3 new diagnoses. Both men and women can become infected. Men who have sex with men, transgender women who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs have a higher risk of contracting HIV. Higher rates of HIV in certain communities may result from issues such as stigma and lack of awareness of someone’s HIV status.\nHow can I get tested for HIV?\nRoutine screening is the best way to reduce the spread of HIV. Screening is recommended for people ages 13 and over and for those with a higher risk of infection. There are three types of tests that may be used for screening and diagnosis:\n\nAntibody tests look for antibodies (proteins) in your blood or saliva that are made by the body in response to an HIV infection\nCombination (fourth-generation) tests look for both HIV antibodies and antigens, which are foreign substances that cause your immune system to activate\nNucleic acid tests look for nucleic acids (genetic material) of HIV in the blood\n\nAsk your health care provider to test you for HIV or visit locator.hiv.gov to find testing sites near you. You can also use an FDA-approved home HIV testing kit.\nHow is HIV treated?\nHIV medications, known as antiretroviral therapy (ART), slow the progression of the disease in your body by lowering the amount of HIV in your blood. This keeps the immune system strong enough to fight off other infections. ART involves taking a combination of HIV medications every day regardless of how long someone has had the virus or how healthy they are. You can also visit HIV.gov to learn more about treatment options.\nBenefits of starting treatment early\n\nSignificantly lower your chances of spreading HIV to HIV-negative people through sex, needle sharing, or from mother to child during childbirth and pregnancy\nLower your chances of getting certain HIV-related cancers and infections\nIncrease your chances of living a longer and healthier life\n\nHIV prevention medications\nPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a method of preventing HIV infection that involves taking HIV medications every day, before possible exposure. Studies show that PrEP lowers the chances of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken daily. Among people who inject drugs, PrEP lowers the chances of getting HIV by at least 74% when taken daily.\nHIV and clinical trials\nThe FDA encourages diverse participation in clinical trials. If you think a clinical trial may be right for you, talk to your health care provider. You can also search for clinical trials in your area at www.ClinicalTrials.gov.\nFor more information on health equity, visit www.fda.gov/healthequity.\n\nDownload HIV Resources\n \n\n\nFact Sheet: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\nBrochure: Living Longer & Healthier With HIV\nInfographics:\n\n3 Things To Know About HIV Treatment\nWhat Is PrEP & Is It Right For You?\n\n\n\nVideos\nEquity of Voices Video Series"

        "content": "Imprimir y compartir (PDF 2074 KB)\nIn English\nEl VPH (virus del papiloma humano) es un virus de transmisión sexual, que se transmite por contacto genital (como el contacto sexual vaginal y anal). También se transmite por contacto cutáneo (piel). Como mínimo, un 50% de las personas que ha tenido relaciones sexuales se infectará con el VPH en algún momento de su vida.\n\n¿Quiénes pueden contraer el VPH?\nVPH y cáncer\n¿Hay una prueba para detectar el VPH?\n¿Puedo prevenir la infección con el VPH?\n\n¿Quiénes pueden contraer el VPH?\nCualquiera que alguna vez haya tenido contacto genital con otra persona puede estar infectado con el VPH. Tanto hombres como mujeres pueden contraer el virus —y contagiarlo— sin saberlo. Como es probable que no se observe ningún signo de la infección, una persona podría estar infectada con el VPH aunque hayan pasado años desde la última vez que tuvo relaciones sexuales. Usted tiene más probabilidades de infectarse con el VPH si:\n\ntuvo relaciones sexuales cuando todavía era muy joven,\ntiene muchas parejas sexuales,\ntiene una pareja sexual que ha tenido muchas parejas.\n\nSi no tengo síntomas, ¿por qué tengo que preocuparme acerca del VPH?\nHay más de 100 tipos diferentes del VPH y no todos ellos ocasionan problemas de salud. Algunos tipos del VPH pueden causar problemas como las verrugas genitales. Otros tipos también pueden causar cáncer del cuello uterino, la vagina, la vulva o el ano. La mayoría de estas enfermedades son causadas por los tipos 6, 11, 16 o 18.\n¿Se cura el VPH?\nNo existe una cura para el virus del papiloma humano (VPH) en sí mismo, pero sí existen tratamientos para los trastornos de salud que el VPH puede causar, tales como verrugas genitales, cambios en el cuello del útero y cáncer cervicouterino.\n¿Qué debo saber acerca de las verrugas genitales?\nExisten muchas opciones de tratamiento para las verrugas genitales. Sin embargo, incluso después del tratamiento de las verrugas, es posible que el virus siga presente y se transmita a otros. Si las verrugas genitales no se tratan podrían irse, permanecer igual, o aumentar en tamaño o número, pero no se convertirán en cáncer.\n¿Hay una prueba para detectar el VPH?\nSí. Se trata de una prueba que detecta los tipos de VPH que pueden derivar en cáncer cervicouterino. La FDA aprobó el uso de la prueba del VPH en mujeres mayores de 30 años de edad. Puede detectar el VPH incluso antes de que se produzcan cambios en el cuello del útero. Las mujeres que se hacen la prueba del VPH deben hacerse la prueba de Papanicolaou de todos modos.\n¿Puedo prevenir la infección con el VPH?\nLa FDA ha aprobado vacunas que previenen ciertas enfermedades, incluso el cáncer cervicouterino, causado por algunos tipos del VPH.  Pregúntele a su médico si debe vacunarse contra el VPH.\n¿Qué otra cosa puedo hacer para reducir las probabilidades de contraer el VPH?\n\nUsted puede optar por no tener relaciones sexuales (abstinencia).\nSi usted tiene relaciones sexuales, podría limitar el número de parejas.\nElija una pareja que haya tenido pocas parejas sexuales o ninguna. Cuantas menos parejas haya tenido su pareja, menores serán las probabilidades de que él o ella tenga el VPH.\nSe desconoce el grado de protección contra el VPH que brindan los condones. Las zonas que no cubre el condón podrían estar expuestas al virus.\n\nVPH y cáncer\n¿Qué debo saber acerca del cáncer cervicouterino?\nTodas las mujeres deben hacerse pruebas de Papanicolaou periódicamente. La prueba de Papanicolaou examina los cambios en las células que causa el VPH y puede detectarlos en forma temprana. De esta forma, es posible tratar el cuello del útero antes de que las células se vuelvan cancerosas. Esta prueba también puede detectar el cáncer en sus fases iniciales, lo que permite su tratamiento antes de que se agrave. Es poco frecuente que el cáncer cervicouterino provoque la muerte si la enfermedad se detecta al comienzo.\n¿Qué debo saber acerca del cáncer vaginal o vulvar?\nEl cáncer vaginal es el cáncer de la vagina (canal del parto). El cáncer vulvar es el cáncer del clítoris, de los labios de la vagina y de la apertura hacia la vagina. Estos dos tipos de cáncer son muy raros. No todos los casos de cáncer vaginal o vulvar son causados por el VPH.\n¿Qué debo saber acerca del cáncer del ano?\nEl cáncer del ano es el que se forma en los tejidos del ano. El ano es la abertura del recto (la última parte del intestino grueso) hacia el exterior del cuerpo.\nPara obtener más información:\n\nHuman Papillomavirus Vaccine\n\nRecursos para usted\n\nLas mujeres y el VIH [Women and HIV]"

        "content": "For Immediate Release:\nJuly 07, 2016\n\n\n\nEspañol\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the Roche cobas HPV Test as the first test for Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) that can be used with cervical cells obtained for a Pap test and collected in SurePath Preservative Fluid.\nThe FDA approves HPV tests to be used with specific collection fluid, which store and preserve cervical cell samples for testing in the laboratory. Until today, the FDA had not approved any HPV tests to be used with SurePath Preservative Fluid, one of two approved liquid collection fluids commonly used for Pap tests.\n“Health care providers have been using samples stored in the SurePath Preservative Fluid with HPV tests for some time now, but there have been concerns about false negative results,” said Alberto Gutierrez, Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Now health care providers have access to an FDA-approved test and the information they need to use it properly to ensure the most accurate results for their patients.”\nPrior to today’s approval, some laboratories used cervical cell samples collected in SurePath Preservative Fluid to run HPV tests, in lieu of collecting an additional sample in a separate collection fluid that had been approved for use with those tests. In 2012, the manufacturer of SurePath warned laboratories that using cervical cell samples in SurePath Preservative Fluid with a specific HPV test may lead to false negative results. Patients who receive false negative HPV test results may not receive appropriate follow-up care, which could lead to cervical cancer progression. The Roche cobas HPV Test now provides specific instructions for laboratories to process cervical samples collected in SurePath Preservative Fluid to minimize the risk of false negative results.\nHPV infections are the most common sexually-transmitted infections in the United States, and HPV genotypes 16 and 18 cause approximately 70 percent of cervical cancers worldwide. According to the National Cancer Institute, there will be an estimated 12,990 new cases and 4,120 deaths from cervical cancer in the United States during 2016.\nThe Roche cobas HPV Test with SurePath Preservative Fluid is approved for use with cervical cell samples obtained for a Pap test to screen women age 30 and older for HPV in order to determine whether additional follow-up and diagnostic procedures are needed. The FDA also approved the Roche cobas HPV Test with SurePath in women age 21 and older who have already had an abnormal Pap test result (borderline cellular cytology) in order to determine whether additional follow-up and diagnostic procedures are needed. The test with SurePath is also able to detect high-risk HPV genotypes 16 and 18 in the same populations of women.\nThe Roche cobas HPV Test with SurePath is not approved as a first-line primary HPV screening test. In addition, health care professionals should use the cobas HPV Test results together with other information, such as the patient screening history and risk factors.\nThe FDA based its approval of the Roche cobas HPV Test with SurePath Preservative Fluid on a clinical study of 952 eligible women 21 years and older with abnormal Pap test results. The Roche cobas HPV Test with SurePath Preservative Fluid demonstrated similar clinical performance when compared to a previously approved cervical sample type. Of the samples that tested positive for HPV using the Roche cobas HPV Test with SurePath, 95.4 percent obtained the same result as the reference sample. Of the samples that tested negative for HPV using the Roche cobas HPV Test with SurePath, 93.2 percent obtained the same result as the reference sample.\nThe Roche cobas HPV Test is manufactured by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., a part of the Roche Group, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland. SurePath Preservative Fluid is manufactured by Becton Dickinson and Company, located in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The Agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nations’ food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\n###\n\n\nInquiries\n\n\n\nMedia:\n\n\n Lyndsay Meyer\n\n\n 240-402-5345\n            \n\n\n\n\nConsumer:\n 888-INFO-FDA"

Approximately one in eight women in the United States will get breast cancer during her lifetime. Each year, more than 40,000 women die from breast cancer.  Early detection of breast cancer can help improve a woman’s chance of survival. \nAlthough mammograms cannot prevent breast cancer, a mammogram is the best primary screening tool to find breast cancer early when it is easier to treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Women should ask their health care provider if and when a mammogram is right for them.\nThe FDA Office of Women’s Health launched the Pink Ribbon Sunday Mammography Awareness Program in 1998 to educate women about early detection of breast cancer through mammography. Pink Ribbon Sunday originally targeted African American and Hispanic churches. \nOver the years, we have expanded our program’s outreach to connect with as many women as possible. We are pleased to share our updated mammography resource, Pink Ribbon Guide: Mammography Matters (PDF, 4.40MB). \n\nSpread the word. Mammograms help save lives. \n \nMake a difference\nWomen may not get recommended mammography screenings for many reasons. They include fear, time, concerns about cost, lack of knowledge about mammography, and limited access to healthcare services.\nYou can help reduce some of these barriers by distributing reliable health information, providing emotional support, and connecting women to local resources. The Pink Ribbon Guide provides information you need to make a difference.\nUse the guide to help inform women about the importance of mammography, provide information and resources, and plan Pink Ribbon events. In the guide, you will find:\n\nBasic facts about mammography\nA customizable flyer and postcard to promote your event\nInformation on how to host an in-person or virtual event\nResources on mammography and breast cancer \n\nThe guide is easy and fun to implement\nThe guide will give you the tools and resources you need to make your event a success.

        "content": "The FDA issued a Final Rule to Amend the MQSA Regulations (“2023 MQSA Final Rule”) on March 10, 2023. Facilities subject to the MQSA and its implementing regulations must comply with all the requirements, including the breast density notification, as of September 10, 2024. The information on this web page has been updated further to confirm the amended MQSA regulations, which are now in effect.\n\n\n\n\nMammogram (General)\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a mammogram?\nA mammogram is a safe, low-dose x-ray picture of the breast. It is currently the most effective primary screening method for detecting breast cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages.\nWhy should I have a mammogram?\nA mammogram can find breast cancer that is too small to be seen or felt. If breast cancer is found early on a mammogram, it can be treated early when it is easier to cure. Early detection may allow a patient to choose breast-conserving surgery and, in some cases, avoid the need for chemotherapy. \nHow is a mammogram done?\nDuring a mammogram, you stand in front of a special x-ray machine. A radiologic technologist lifts each breast and places it on a platform that detects x-rays. A clear plastic plate then gently presses the breast against the platform. Some pressure is applied for a few seconds to ensure the x-rays capture as much of the breast as possible. This pressure is not harmful and, while it might be uncomfortable, most patients find the discomfort brief and manageable.\nShould patients be concerned about radiation dose during mammography?\nNo. The risk of harm from radiation is very small when compared to the benefits of early breast cancer detection.\nWhat is a screening mammogram?\nA screening mammogram is a quick and easy method to detect breast cancer early, when treatment is more effective and survival rates are higher. It involves taking an x-ray of the breast to check for any changes in women who have no symptoms of breast cancer. Typically, two x-ray images are taken of each breast, and a qualified physician trained to interpret mammograms reviews them later.\nWhat is a diagnostic mammography exam?\nA healthcare provider uses a diagnostic mammogram to help learn the cause of a person's breast problems such as a breast mass, skin changes, or nipple discharge. Diagnostic mammography takes a little longer than screening mammography because more x-rays are taken. A qualified physician may review the mammograms while you wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotification of Mammography Exam Results\n\n\n\n\nHow will a patient get the results of their mammogram?\nA mammography facility must provide each patient with a written summary of the exam results. The summary can be handed to the patient at the time of the exam, provided electronically (e.g., patient portal), or mailed to the patient within 30 calendar days after the exam. The summary must be written in lay terms or words a patient can easily understand. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)). A more detailed version of the results will be sent to the patient’s doctor or healthcare provider.\nHow will patients who do not have a doctor or other healthcare provider get their results?\nA mammography facility will provide a patient with the patient's written summary of the results and a copy of the technical report within 30 days of the exam. If necessary, the facility personnel will refer the patient to a healthcare provider.  Facilities must have a system for referring such patients to a healthcare provider when clinically indicated, including when the assessment is either “Probably Benign,” “Suspicious,” or “Highly Suggestive of Malignancy.” (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)(ii)).\nWhat should patients do if they do not receive their written results within 30 days?\nIf a patient does not receive their written summary of the results within 30 calendar days, they should contact the mammography facility or their healthcare provider to request the summary of the results of the exam. This is very important.  If the issue is not resolved, the patient should file a consumer complaint with the facility's accreditation body (see the Mammography Program Referral List).\nAre there special considerations for reporting results when they are \"Suspicious\" or \"Highly Suggestive of Malignancy\"?\nYes. In these cases, the facility must provide the written summary of the results to the patient within seven calendar days of the final interpretation of the mammogram. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)).  Some facilities may discuss the results with the patient following the exam or contact the patient by phone. Even if the results are given to the patient verbally, the patient must receive the written summary of the results within seven calendar days of the final interpretation if the assessment of the mammography report is Suspicious or Highly Suggestive of Malignancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtaining Original Mammograms\n\n\n\n\nHow can patients get their \"original\" mammograms (x-rays)?\nOriginal mammograms are especially important when the mammogram was performed using screen-film technology. However, most mammograms today use digital technologies such as Full-Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) or Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT). For these digital technologies, identical copies can be provided, while the original images are kept by the performing facility, so digital originals are usually not transferred.\nIf patients need original screen-film mammograms, they can request them from the facility, or have someone else make the request. They can ask the facility to send the original mammograms either temporarily or permanently to another medical facility, their doctor, or to themselves. The facility may ask the patient to fill out a form to release the medical records. If the facility charges a fee for this service, the fee must not be more than it costs them (i.e., the documented costs) to provide this service. (See 21 CFR 900.12(c)(4)(ii), (iii), & (iv)).\nFor example, patients who had a screen-film mammogram may request their original mammogram if they:\n\nChange mammography facilities\nMake an appointment for a second mammographic opinion, or an appointment with a surgeon, oncologist, or radiation therapist\nNeed earlier mammograms to compare with current ones\n\nWhat should a patient do if their facility refuses to permanently transfer the original mammograms and other medical records to another facility or to their doctor?\nThis question only arises for screen-film mammograms, as most mammograms today use digital technologies (FFDM or DBT). If a patient has a complaint, they should first file it with the facility's accreditation body listed on the MQSA certificate. If the accreditation body is unable to resolve the complaint, it will refer the case to the FDA or the State Certifying Agency.\nSome facilities may claim that State or local law require them to retain permanent records, but this practice is contrary to the MQSA regulations. If the facility has a signed statement from the patient requesting the transfer of records, the facility will not be cited under MQSA for failure to retain the records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMammography Facilities\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a mammography facility?\nA mammography facility is a hospital, outpatient department, clinic, radiology practice, mobile unit, an office of a physician, or other facility that conducts breast screening or diagnosis through mammography procedures.\nDo patients need to have a doctor or other healthcare provider refer them to a mammography facility?\nA patient can have a mammography exam and receive the follow-up report without a doctor's or provider's referral. This is known as \"self referral.\" Before an exam, a patient should verify that the facility accepts self-referred patients because some facilities do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertified Facilities/Certificates\n\n\n\n\nWhat does certification mean?\nCertification means that a mammography facility has been MQSA certified and is capable of providing quality mammography. Certification is issued by the FDA or, for facilities located in the States of Illinois, Iowa, South Carolina, or Texas, by the respective State's FDA-approved Certification Agency. \nA facility that is certified has either: \n\nCompleted a rigorous review of its practices by an FDA-approved accreditation body, or \nIs undergoing the process of accreditation by one of the three accreditation bodies. \n\nThe three accreditation bodies are the:\n\nAmerican College of Radiology \nState of Arkansas \nState of Texas\n\nFor more information, visit Facility Accreditation and Certification.\nDo the three FDA-approved accreditation bodies have the same requirements for quality mammography?\nYes. Patients can be assured that all mammography facilities accredited by any FDA-approved accreditation body are held to the same quality standards. Each accreditation body has met the same stringent FDA requirements for approval. The name of your facility's accreditation body can be found on the MQSA certificate at the facility.\nAre all facilities practicing mammography now certified?\nAll facilities subject to MQSA should be either certified for three years or provisionally certified while they undergo accreditation review. Not all facilities that apply for accreditation meet the quality standards. If a facility is not certified, it must stop providing mammography.\nWhat is a provisionally certified facility?\nA provisionally certified facility has had its application accepted by an FDA-approved accreditation body, and the quality aspects of the facility are under review. A provisional certificate is valid for up to six months.\nHow can a consumer verify that a facility is certified to perform quality mammography?\nSearch a list of FDA-certified mammography facilities by State or ZIP Code.\nAt the facility, patients should look for the MQSA certificate indicating that they are in a certified mammography facility. The certificate should be prominently displayed. All certificates have an expiration date, and only facilities with a valid (unexpired) certificate can lawfully provide mammography services. Patients should first inform the facility and then report it to the accreditation body listed on the certificate if the facility is displaying an expired certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosed Mammography Facilities\n\n\n\n\nWhat should a consumer do if they find that their facility is no longer providing mammography services?\nThey should contact the facility, if possible, and request that the facility transfer their original mammograms and other associated records to a certified mammography facility, their physician, or themselves. This transfer of X-rays and records is important because the interpreting physician compares the new mammograms with old ones to see if there have been any changes. \nIf it is not possible to contact the facility (for example, they have gone out of business), the consumer can contact the MQSA Hotline at 1-800-838-7715 for assistance in trying to obtain their images or records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer Complaints\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a serious complaint?\nA serious complaint is defined as a report of an event that may significantly compromise the clinical results of a mammography exam or an event for which a facility fails to take appropriate corrective action in a timely manner. Examples of serious complaints include: \n\nPoor image quality\nUse of radiologists or other facility personnel who don't meet MQSA standards\nFailure to notify patients of exam results within 30 days\nFailure to transfer original mammograms upon request of the patient or their representative.\n\nWhat should consumers do if they have serious concerns about the quality of their exam?\nIf a consumer has a serious concern about the quality of their mammogram, they should first contact the complaint coordinator at the facility. If they are not satisfied with the response, they should request the name and phone number of the contact person at the facility’s accreditation body. If contacting the accreditation body does not resolve the issue, they can contact the FDA or the FDA-approved Certification Agency that certifies the facility.\nFDA Contact Information\nMQSA Hotline 1-800-838-7715\nDivision of Mammography Quality Standards\nOffice of Radiological Health\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nWO66-3621B\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nIf a facility is located in Illinois, Iowa, South Carolina, or Texas, consumers should contact the State’s certification agency rather than the FDA.

O. Box 149347\nAustin, Texas\nPhone: 512-834-6688\nWho are the complaint contacts at the accreditation bodies?\nPlease refer to the FDA's Mammography Program Referral List for the names, addresses and phone numbers of the accreditation body complaint contacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreast Implants\n\n\n\n\nShould a patient with breast implants have a mammography exam to look for breast cancer?\nYes, patients with breast implants who are in the age group recommended for routine screening can effectively have mammograms. (Those who have had implants as reconstruction after breast cancer surgery on both breasts should ask their doctors to determine if mammograms are still necessary.) When scheduling an appointment, patients should:\n\nInform the facility that they have breast implants\nAsk if the facility has personnel with training and experience in implant imaging and interpretation.\n\nSkilled personnel will use special techniques to include as much breast tissue as possible.\nIf the facility does not have personnel trained in implant imaging, patients should request a referral to another facility.\nShould mammograms be used to detect breast implant rupture?\nAlthough implant rupture can sometimes be seen by mammography, when possible, silicone implant rupture is typically evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI has been approved by the FDA for detecting rupture or leaks.\n\n\n\nInformation for Mammography Facilities\n\n\n\n\nMobile Facilities\n\n\n\n\nDo mobile mammography facilities meet the same requirements as stationary facilities?\nYes. MQSA requirements apply to all mammography facilities. The same standards for image quality apply to both stationary and mobile facilities. Mobile facilities must prominently display an FDA certificate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspections\n\n\n\n\nDoes the FDA inspect mammography facilities?\nYes. The FDA implemented annual inspection of all mammography facilities in 1995. The agency has trained State and FDA inspectors to perform these inspections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotifying Patients of Adverse Events\n\n\n\n\nWhat will happen if there is a problem at a facility?\nIf the FDA or a State Certification Agency determines that problems at a mammography facility could significantly affect the quality of the images and results, the facility or Certification Agency will notify patients and their providers. Poor-quality mammograms can lead to incorrect exam results. The mammography facility or Certification Agency will usually contact patients and providers by letter.\nWhat information will be in the letter telling patients about problems at a facility?\nThe letter usually will tell the patient what happened at the facility and what they should do for medical follow-up. For example, the patient may be advised to have their mammogram reevaluated or to have a repeat mammogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment\n\n\n\n\nWill Medicare still pay for mammography performed at facilities that are not MQSA-certified?\nNo, because such a facility is operating illegally. Furthermore, the FDA has asked other insurance carriers not to pay for mammography performed at uncertified facilities. Consumers should call the Medicare Hotline at 1-800-Medicare (1-800-633-4227) for information about coverage for mammography services. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees Medicare. They can also contact their personal insurance carrier about coverage for mammography services.\nWill Medicaid still pay for mammography services performed at facilities that are not MQSA-certified?\nNo, because they are operating illegally. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, alerted State Medicaid Directors to avoid paying claims to mammography facilities that are not MQSA-certified. Patients may wish to call the local Medicaid office for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVeterans Health Administration Facilities\n\n\n\n\nAre Veterans Administration facilities required to meet the standards of MQSA?\nVeterans Health Administration (VA) facilities are exempted from MQSA. However, the VA has initiated its own quality mammography program with standards as strict as those required by MQSA. All VA facilities are required to be accredited by the American College of Radiology. They are also inspected annually by MQSA-trained inspectors.\nHow can a patient locate the nearest VA mammography facility?\nThe Women Veterans Call Center (WVCC) receives and responds to questions from women Veterans, their families, and caregivers across the nation about available VA services and resources. The phone number for the WVCC is 1-855-VA-WOMEN or 1-855-829-6636. The WVCC operates Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. ET and on Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\n\n\nInformation about the MQSA\n\n\n\n\nThe Act\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Mammography Quality Standards Act?\nThe Mammography Quality Standards Act requires mammography facilities across the nation to meet uniform quality standards. Congress passed this law in 1992 to assure high-quality mammography for early breast cancer detection, which can lead to early treatment, a range of treatment options, and increased chances of survival. Under the law, all mammography facilities must: 1) be accredited by an FDA-approved accreditation body, 2) be certified by the FDA, or its State, as meeting the standards, 3) undergo an annual MQSA inspection, and 4) prominently display the certificate issued by the agency.\nWhat standards are mammography facilities required to meet for FDA certification?\nThe FDA, along with the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee, developed comprehensive regulations (issued on October 28, 1997) that became effective on April 28, 1999. The regulations apply to the following:\n\nPersonnel: Physicians who interpret mammograms, radiologic technologists who perform mammography, and medical physicists who survey equipment must have adequate training and experience.\nQuality Control/Record-keeping: Each facility must have an effective quality control program and maintain certain records.\nMedical Audit: Each facility must have a system to collect and review outcome data for all mammographic examinations performed and for obtaining biopsy results.\n\nThe standards also require that facilities undergo annual inspections by the FDA or State inspectors who must successfully complete the FDA training program designed specifically for mammography facility evaluation.\nHas MQSA improved mammography quality?\nYes. According to the October 1997 report to Congress by the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office), MQSA positively impacted the quality of mammography services. The report identified two main reasons for these quality improvements:\n\nMany facilities previously failed to follow voluntary standards or guidelines.\nThe FDA's annual inspection process provides a valuable, systematic means of helping to ensure that these higher standards are maintained.\n\nWhile many facilities had to improve their services to meet the MQSA standards, very few facilities had to close for failing to meet the standards. In most instances, those facilities that closed were located within five miles of another certified facility, indicating that women could continue to have access to mammography services at that time. In some cases, closed facilities either merged with another facility or contracted with mobile service providers to continue serving their patients.\nHow are mammography patients affected by the MQSA regulations?\nThe FDA, along with the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee, developed comprehensive regulations that became effective on April 28, 1999. Those regulations, published in the October 28, 1997, Federal Register, replaced the interim regulations under which facilities had previously operated.\nThe current regulations include the following areas of importance for patients:\n\nMammography facilities are required to provide patients with written results of their mammograms in language that is easy to understand.\nA consumer complaint mechanism is required to be established in mammography facilities to provide patients with a process for addressing their concerns.\nPatients can obtain their original mammograms, not copies, when they are needed.\nFor cases in which a facility's mammograms are determined to be substandard and a risk to public health, facilities will notify the patients and their doctors and suggest an appropriate plan of action.\n\nA subsequent rule amending the MQSA regulations was published in the Federal Register on March 10, 2023. Starting September 10, 2024, mammography facilities must comply with all the requirements, including the breast density notification.\nThe updated regulations are intended to expand the information required to be shared with patients and healthcare professionals, allowing for more informed medical decision-making. Helping to promote patient access to information about the impact that breast density and other factors can have on the risk for developing breast cancer is an important part of a comprehensive breast health strategy.\n\nThe final rule includes new mammogram reporting requirements that require mammography facilities to inform patients and their healthcare providers of the patient's breast density, creating four categories for reporting breast tissue density in the medical report that is sent to the healthcare provider.\n\t\n“The breasts are almost entirely fatty.”\n“There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density.”\n“The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses.”\n“The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography.”\n\n\nThe lay language summaries that facilities provide to patients must include a message written in easy-to-understand terms, that shares their breast density and encourages them to speak with their healthcare provider. For example:\n\t\nNot dense: \"Breast tissue can be either dense or not dense. Dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also raises the risk of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is not dense. Talk to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation.\"\nDense: \"Breast tissue can be either dense or not dense. Dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also raises the risk of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is dense. In some people with dense tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers. Talk to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation.\"\n\n\nUnder the final rule, medical reports to healthcare providers and patient summaries must include expanded information about the mammography facility, including the name and address, to better facilitate communication with and among mammography facilities.\nThe final rule also codifies three additional categories for the assessments of mammograms that have already been approved by the agency as alternative standards so that facilities can more precisely classify and communicate mammographic findings to healthcare providers:\n\t\nKnown Biopsy Proven Malignancy – for known malignancies being mammographically evaluated for definitive therapy.\nPost Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement – for a mammogram taken following a biopsy to confirm the deployment and position of a breast tissue marker.\nIncomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison – for examinations where comparison with prior mammograms should be performed before an assessment category can be given.\n\n\n\nExisting classifications prior to these amendments included: negative, benign, probably benign, suspicious, highly suggestive of malignancy, and incomplete: need additional imaging evaluation.\n\nThese new requirements increase the clarity of communication between mammography facilities, healthcare providers, and patients, and help ensure that healthcare providers and patients obtain the necessary information from the mammography facility to enable a patient and their healthcare provider to make informed medical decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FDA's Mammography Program Referral List \n\n\n\n\nMedia Related Calls\n\nContact the FDA’s Office of Media Affairs\n\nCongressional Inquires\n\nContact FDA’s Office of Legislation\n\nComplaints\nAbout facilities operating without an FDA certificate:\n\nThe FDA MQSA Hotline – 1-800-838-7715\n\nAbout a mammography facility's services:\n\nContact the facility's accreditation body.

        "topic": "FDA Updates mammography regulations to require reporting of breast density information and enhance facility oversight",
        "content": "For Immediate Release:\nMarch 09, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nToday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published updates to the mammography regulations to, among other things, require mammography facilities to notify patients about the density of their breasts, strengthen the FDA’s oversight and enforcement of facilities and help interpreting physicians better categorize and assess mammograms.\n“Today’s action represents the agency’s broader commitment to support innovation to prevent, detect and treat cancer,” said Hilary Marston, M.D., M.P.H., FDA’s Chief Medical Officer. “Since 1992, the FDA has worked to ensure patients have access to quality mammography. The impact of the Mammography Quality Standards Act on public health has been significant, including a steep decrease in the number of facilities that do not meet quality standards. This means that more women have access to consistent, quality mammography. We remain committed to advancing efforts to improve the health of women and strengthen the fight against breast cancer.” \nThe final rule amends regulations issued under the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) of 1992, a law passed to ensure quality mammography, which is very important for early breast cancer detection. The MQSA authorizes FDA oversight over mammography facilities, including their accreditation, certification, annual inspections and enforcement of standards to help ensure mammography facilities provide quality care.\nOne of the key updates to regulations under the MQSA requires facilities to provide information to patients regarding the density of their breasts. Approximately half of women over the age of 40 in the U.S. have dense breast tissue, a description of its appearance on a mammogram. Dense breast tissue can make cancers more difficult to detect on a mammogram. Additionally, dense breasts have been identified as a risk factor for developing breast cancer. The amendments finalized today provide specific language explaining how breast density can influence the accuracy of mammography. They recommend patients with dense breasts talk to their health care provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer and their individual situation.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in eight women will get breast cancer in her life, impacting hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. Mammograms continue to be the best tool for breast cancer screening and detection.\nHelping to promote patient access to information about the impact that breast density and other factors can have on the risk for developing breast cancer is an important part of a comprehensive breast health strategy. \nToday’s amendments, which are required to be implemented within 18 months, enhance the FDA’s oversight of mammography facilities, including in the key areas of enforcement and patient communication. While nearly all certified mammography facilities continue to meet quality standards, today’s updates, among other things, enhance the FDA’s ability to communicate directly, if needed, with patients and their health care providers in cases where a facility did not meet quality standards and is not adequately communicating with patients about its deficiencies. This is intended to help ensure important information that could affect decisions about patient care, such as the potential need for further evaluation or a repeat mammogram, is communicated as completely as possible.\nThe amendments also help bring the MQSA into the 21st century, including modernizing the regulations by incorporating current science and mammography best practices to improve breast cancer detection and helping empower patients with more information when they are considering important decisions regarding their breast health care.\nRelated Information\n\nRelated Information\n\nMammography Quality Standards Act Final Rule\nMammography Quality Standards Act and Program\nWomen’s Health Topics: Mammography\n\n\n\n###\n\n\nBoilerplate\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\n\n\tThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has updated mammography regulations to, among other things, modernize breast cancer mammography screening and empower patients by providing more information when they consider their breast health care. On March 10, 2023, the FDA published a final rule amending Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) regulations. Mammography facilities have 18 months from the time of publication to implement the regulations. For more details please see, Frequently Asked Questions About MQSA.\n\nMammograms continue to be the best primary tool for breast cancer screening. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, along with some FDA-approved state certifying agencies, certify facilities to perform mammography. The FDA also clears, approves, and authorizes new mammography devices for sale in the U.S.\nCongress enacted the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) in 1992 to ensure all women have access to quality mammography for the detection of breast cancer in its early, most treatable stages. Always look for the MQSA certificate at the mammography facility, which is required to be displayed and indicates that the facility meets the national baseline standards for mammography.\nTo continue to protect women's health, the FDA has updated mammography regulations to, among other things, reflect advances in mammography technology and processes since the current regulations were published.\nHow Does a Mammogram Work?\nA mammogram is a series of low-dose X-ray images of the breasts. Getting a regular mammogram is the best primary screening method to find breast cancer early, because it can show growths in the breast or other signs of breast cancer when they are too small for you or your health care provider to feel them.\nThermograms and nipple aspirate tests are not substitutes for mammograms. Regular screening mammograms are important, and the risk of developing breast cancers varies from person to person, so it's a good idea to ask your health care provider when and how often you should schedule a mammogram.\nTo get a mammogram, you will need to take off your shirt and bra. While standing in front of the mammogram unit, a technologist will position your breast on a small platform. A clear plastic plate will press down on your breast while a mammogram image is acquired. This compression of the breast helps spread out the breast tissue so that it doesn't overlap as much, allowing for a clearer look at the breast tissue.\nIf you’re worried about how the procedure feels, you should know that most women do not find it painful. Some women may find the pressure on the breast uncomfortable, but it usually lasts for only a few seconds.\nThe FDA’s regulations already require that facilities provide patients an easy-to-understand summary of their mammography results within 30 days after the mammogram, and that they make reasonable attempts to communicate the results as soon as possible if indications of potential cancer are found.\nThe FDA has amended the regulations to require that facilities also provide you with information about whether your breast tissue is dense or not dense. Dense breasts have a higher proportion of fibroglandular tissue compared to fatty tissue. This is important, because dense breast tissue can make cancers more difficult to find using a mammogram; and it is also now known to be an independent risk factor for developing breast cancer.\nIn addition, the FDA is requiring that facilities advise you to talk to your health care provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation. The idea is to provide information you can discuss with your provider to make better informed decisions, including if you need to consider any next steps.\nIf you do not receive your mammography summary report, call the provider who sent you for the mammogram to get your results, and contact the facility where you had the mammogram performed to get the report resent to you.\nCall your health care provider if you notice any change in either of your breasts. A lump, thickening of or leakage from the nipple, or changes in how the nipple or skin looks can signal a potential problem.\nWhy Is Facility Certification Important?\nUnder the MQSA, mammography facilities must be certified by the FDA, or an FDA-approved state certifying agency, to provide mammography services. Certification is important because it indicates that a facility has met the MQSA requirements for practicing quality mammography. A high-quality mammogram can help detect breast cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages.\nEach mammography facility is inspected every year. During the inspection, an FDA or FDA-trained inspector checks the facility’s equipment, staff training qualifications, and quality control records. Each facility also undergoes an in-depth accreditation process every three years to be eligible for an MQSA certificate.\nThe certificate, which is required to be prominently displayed, shows that the facility has met the MQSA quality standards and may legally perform mammography. When you arrive for your mammogram, look for the certificate. If you don’t see it, ask for where the certificate is in the facility.\nWhat Are 3D Mammograms?\n\n\tScientists at the FDA assess the performance of different breast imaging technologies. Here’s a look inside a lab where FDA scientists help make sure mammography machines are safe and effective.\n\n\nNew breast imaging equipment must receive the FDA’s approval, clearance, or authorization before being sold in the U.S. The FDA has approved digital breast tomosynthesis (known as DBT or 3D) advanced mammography devices that can create multiple cross-sectional images of the breast from X-rays taken from multiple angles. These devices provide informative images of the breast tissue and may be helpful in evaluating dense breast tissue.\nBefore granting approval, the FDA determined there was a reasonable assurance that the new 3D devices were safe and effective for their intended use. This determination was based on a review of clinical studies involving multiple radiologists and hundreds of cases. The FDA also sought input on the safety and effectiveness of the devices from a panel of non-FDA clinical and technical experts.\nWhere Is the Closest Certified Facility?\nThere are more than 8,600 MQSA-certified facilities across the country. To find a certified mammography facility in your area, you can search the list on the FDA’s website by your zip code. The list is updated weekly.\nHow Will the Changes to the MQSA Regulations Help You?\nThe updates to the MQSA regulations would, among additional changes:\n\nBetter inform you and your health care provider about your mammography results by providing specific information on breast density, an important risk factor for breast cancer.\nStrengthen the FDA's ability to suspend or revoke the certificates of facilities that are noncompliant with the regulations.\nRequire facilities to provide mammography personnel access to their own records of MQSA-qualifying training and experience upon their request, so they may continue to provide mammography services."

        "content": "The following Q&As provide information for consumers about Digital Mammography.\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nWhat is digital mammography?\nWhat is DBT?\nHow can women find an FDA-certified digital mammography facility?\nDo private insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid pay for digital mammography exams, such as DBT?\n\nWhat is digital mammography?\nFull field digital mammography (FFDM, also known simply as \"digital mammography\") is a mammography system where the x-ray film used in screen-film mammography is replaced by solid-state detectors, similar to those found in digital cameras, which convert x-rays into electrical signals. The electrical signals are used to produce images of the breast that can be seen on a computer screen, or printed on special films to look like screen-film mammograms. Types of digital mammography include direct radiography (the most common type, which captures the image directly onto a flat-panel detector), computed radiography (which involves the use of a cassette that contains an imaging plate), or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT).\n\n\nWhat is DBT?\nDigital breast tomosynthesis is a relatively new technology. In DBT, the X-ray tube moves in an arc around the breast and takes multiple images from different angles. Similar to computed tomography (CT scan), these images are then reconstructed into parallel “slices” through the breast. This allows interpreting physicians to see through layers of overlapping tissue.\n\n\nHow can women find an FDA-certified digital mammography facility?\nDigital mammography has been in use since 2001. Over ninety-nine percent of all certified mammography facilities in the US use digital units of some type. You can find a list of certified facilities, searchable by state or ZIP Code, at www.fda.gov/findmammography.\n\n\nDo private insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid pay for digital mammography exams, such as DBT?\nWe recommend that you contact your insurance provider before the procedure to determine what procedures are covered by your insurance plan. The telephone number for questions about Medicare reimbursement is 1-800-MEDICARE. To find the number for MEDICAID, look in your local directory."

        "topic": "Breast cancer screening: thermogram no substitute for mammogram",
        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption\nA mammogram (L) is an X-ray image of the breast that can identify tissue types with different densities, such as masses within the breast. Thermography (R) produces an infrared image that shows the patterns of heat on or near the surface of the body.\n\n\n\nEspañol\nProper breast cancer screening checks for cancer even before there may be signs and symptoms of the disease. Mammography (low-dose X-ray imaging of the breast) is still the most effective primary screening method for detecting breast cancer in its early, most treatable stages.\nSome health centers provide information that can mislead patients into believing thermography, a type of test that shows patterns of heat on or near the surface of the body, is a proven alternative to mammography. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is not aware of any scientific evidence to support these claims.\nThermography has not been shown to be effective as a standalone test for breast cancer screening and detecting early-stage breast cancer.\nMammography vs. Thermography\nThe FDA regulates the medical devices used for breast cancer screening.\nAbout 1 in 8 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer sometime in their lives, reports the National Cancer Institute. Men can develop breast cancer, but it happens much less often than in women. Early detection of breast cancer by using mammography reduces the risk of breast cancer death and increases treatment options, according to the American Cancer Society. One of the greatest risks from thermography is that those who opt for this method instead of mammography may miss the chance to detect breast cancer at its earliest stage.\nThermography devices have only been cleared by the FDA as an “adjunctive” tool, referring to use alongside a primary screening test like mammography. Patients who undergo a thermography test alone should not be reassured of the findings because the device was not cleared to be used without another testing method like mammography. (For more about mammography, including how it works and how to find a certified facility, visit Mammography: What You Need to Know.)\nMoreover, some websites claim thermography can find breast cancer years before it would be detected through other methods, and they have unproven claims about improved detection of cancer in dense breasts using thermography. The FDA is not aware of any evidence that supports these claims.\nThe FDA has taken, and will continue to take, appropriate regulatory action against thermography device manufacturers who market thermography devices as an alternative to mammography.\nAdvice for Patients Getting Breast Cancer Screening\nSome women have sought out thermography because it is painless and does not require exposure to radiation.\nIf you are worried about how a mammogram feels, talk to your health care professional about what you can expect. A mammogram can be uncomfortable for the person being screened because it briefly presses on the breast to spread the breast tissue and increase the clarity of the X-ray image. (For more about what to expect during a mammogram, visit Mammography.)\nAlso talk to your health care professional if you have specific questions about mammography, including questions about when and how frequently you should be screened. As a rule, also call your health care professional if you notice any change in either of your breasts such as a lump, area of thickening of or leakage from the nipple, or changes in how the nipple looks."

        "topic": "What to know about breast implants",
        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\n\n\n\t  UPDATE: In March 2023, the FDA issued a safety communication with updated information about squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the scar tissue (capsule) around breast implants. The March 2023 communication updates the September 2022 safety communication that informed the public about reports of cancers, including SCC and various lymphomas, in the capsule. The various lymphomas are not the same as the lymphomas described previously by FDA as Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). The FDA believes cases of SCC and lymphomas in the capsule may be rare. The FDA recommends health care providers talk with people who have or are considering breast implants about SCC and various lymphomas in the capsule around breast implants.  The FDA continues to ask health care providers and people with breast implants to report cases of any cancers around breast implants to the FDA.\n\t\n\nShould I get breast implants? Should they be saline or silicone? Which style? How much monitoring is needed after surgery?\nThose are common questions people have when considering breast implants.\nThat’s why the FDA offers the following information to  help people make informed decisions about whether or not to use breast implants.\nThe FDA has approved implants for increasing breast size (known as augmentation), for reconstruction after breast cancer surgery or trauma, and to correct developmental defects. The FDA has also approved breast implants to correct or improve the result of a previous surgery.\nThere are two types of FDA-approved breast implants: saline-filled (saltwater solution) and silicone gel-filled. Both have a silicone outer shell and vary in size, shell thickness, shell surface texture, and shape (contour).\nKnow the Risks of Breast Implants\nFDA-approved implants undergo extensive testing before approval to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Still, there are risks associated with all breast implants, including:\n\nAdditional surgeries\nBreast implant associated-anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), which is a cancer of the immune system\nSystemic symptoms, commonly referred to as Breast Implant Illness (BII)\nCapsular contracture (scar tissue that squeezes the implant)\nBreast pain\nRupture (tears or holes in the shell) of saline and silicone gel-filled implants\n\t\nDeflation (with visible change to breast size) of saline-filled implants\nSilent (without symptoms) rupture of silicone gel-filled implants\n\n\nInfection\n\nThe silicone used for breast implants is different than injectable silicone. Injectable silicone is not FDA-approved for breast augmentation, breast reconstruction, or for body contouring.\nBreast Implants Are Not Lifetime Devices\nThe longer you have breast implants, the greater the chances are that you will develop complications, some of which will require more surgery.\nThe life of breast implants varies by person and cannot be predicted. That means everyone with breast implants may need additional surgeries, but no one can predict when. Patients can also request additional surgeries to modify the size or shape of their breasts.\nUnderstand Product Labeling for Implants\nTo help patients be aware of the risks of breast implants before their surgery, the FDA requires that all FDA-approved breast implants include labeling with easy-to-understand information about the benefits and risks associated with the product. This requirement is intended to enhance the discussions patients have with their doctor about the benefits and risks of implants. The mandatory labeling information includes a patient decision checklist that highlights key information about risks; warning information formatted in a box to make it noticeable; and a patient device card with information specific to a patient’s implant, such as the serial or lot number and the style and size.\nThe FDA restricts the sale and distribution of breast implants to only health care providers and facilities that provide information to patients using the patient decision checklist. The patient must be given the opportunity to initial and sign the checklist before agreeing to surgery and it must be signed by the physician implanting the device.\nAdditionally, the FDA advises that patients read the Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data and product labeling for each implant to learn about the materials used to construct the device, device characteristics and the fillers used. The Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data have been produced for all approved saline and silicone gel-filled breast implants. The Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data and the product labeling provide information on the indications for use, risks, warnings, precautions, and studies associated with the FDA’s approval of the device.\nThe Summary of Safety and Effectiveness Data also provides information on clinical study used for device approval. The most serious complications are those that lead to further surgeries, such as ruptures or capsular contracture, or BIA-ALCL diagnosis.\nCommunicate with Your Surgeon\nSurgeons will discuss the shape, size, surface texture, placement of the implant, and the incision site for each person. Ask your surgeon questions about their experience in performing breast implant surgeries, the surgical procedure, and the ways the implant might affect your life.\nTell your surgeon about previous surgeries and your body’s response. For example, discuss whether surgeries resulted in a more than expected amount of scar tissue. Also, discuss your expectations. These discussions will help you and the surgeon make decisions that achieve the desired appearance, including decisions about incision location and size, as well as implant size, material, texture, and placement.\nMany patients have additional operations to change implant size. To achieve the best results after the first procedure, careful planning and reasonable expectations are necessary.\nKnow the Long-Term Risks of Breast Implants\nThe FDA has identified an association between breast implants and the development of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Patients who have breast implants may have an increased risk of developing this cancer which mostly develops in the fluid or scar tissue surrounding the implant.\nBreast implants have either smooth or textured surfaces (shells). BIA-ALCL develops more frequently in patients with textured implants than in those with smooth-surfaced implants. Like other lymphomas, BIA-ALCL is a cancer of the immune system and not of breast tissue.\nSome patients with implants have also reported health problems such as connective tissue diseases (such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis), trouble breastfeeding, or reproductive problems. There is currently insufficient evidence to support an association between breast implants and those diagnoses.\nAdditionally, some patients receiving breast implants have reported a variety of systemic symptoms such as joint pain, muscle aches, confusion, chronic fatigue, autoimmune diseases, and others. Individual patient risk for developing these symptoms has not been well established.\nMonitor Your Breast Implants\nIn general, follow your surgeon’s instructions on how to monitor your breast implants.\nIf you notice any unusual signs or symptoms, report them promptly to your surgeon or health care provider. Health care providers and patients are encouraged to report adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.\nAlso, follow your health care provider’s instructions for imaging for screening for breast cancer as this may be different for those patients who had breast augmentation and for those patients who had breasts reconstruction. If you are making an appointment for mammography, inform the mammography facility that you have breast implants, and ask them what you can expect regarding mammography with breast implants.\nYour surgeon or health care provider may also recommend other tests, such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The FDA recommends that patients with silicone implants get regular screenings to detect silent ruptures.\nIf you have specific questions about breast implants, ask your surgeon or health care provider.\nAdditional Resources\n\nUPDATE: Reports of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) in the Capsule Around Breast Implants: FDA Safety Communication\nBreast Implants: Reports of Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Various Lymphomas in Capsule Around Implants: FDA Safety Communication\nAcellular Dermal Matrix (ADM) Products Used in Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction Differ in Complication Rates: FDA Safety Communication\nThe FDA Requests Allergan Voluntarily Recall Natrelle BIOCELL Textured Breast Implants and Tissue Expanders from the Market to Protect Patients: FDA Safety Communication"

        "topic": "How to Dispose of Unused Medicines",
        "content": "Español\nIs your medicine cabinet full of expired drugs or medications you no longer use? Your medicine is for you. What’s safe for you might be harmful for someone else. The best way to dispose of your expired, unwanted, or unused medicines is through a drug take back program — or you can do it at home.\nDrug Take Back Programs\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sponsors National Prescription Drug Take Back Day in communities nationwide. Many communities also have their own drug take back programs. Check with your local law enforcement officials to find a location near you or with the DEA to find a DEA-authorized collector in your community.\nYou can also check with your pharmacist. Some pharmacies offer on-site medicine drop-off boxes, mail-back programs, and other ways to help you safely dispose your unused medicines.\nHow to Dispose of Medicines at Home\nWhen a take back option is not easily available, there are two ways to dispose of medicines at home, depending on the drug.\nFlushing medicines: Because some medicines could be especially harmful to others, they have specific directions to immediately flush them down the sink or toilet when they are no longer needed, and a take-back option is not readily available.\nHow will you know? Check the label or the patient information leaflet with your medicine. Or consult the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s list of medicines recommended for disposal by flushing when a take back option is not readily available. Remember, don’t flush your medicine unless it is on the flush list.\nDisposing medicines in household trash: If a take back program is not available, almost all medicines, except those on the FDA flush list (see below),  can be thrown into your household trash. These include prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in pills, liquids, drops, patches, and creams.\nFollow these steps:\n\nRemove the drugs from their original containers and mix them with something undesirable, such as used coffee grounds, dirt, or cat litter. This makes the medicine less appealing to children and pets and unrecognizable to someone who might intentionally go through the trash looking for drugs.\nPut the mixture in something you can close (a re-sealable zipper storage bag, empty can, or other container) to prevent the drug from leaking or spilling out.\nThrow the container in the garbage.\nScratch out all your personal information on the empty medicine packaging to protect your identity and privacy. Throw the packaging away.\n\nIf you have a question about your medicine, ask your health care provider or pharmacist.\nDisposing Fentanyl Patches\nThe fentanyl patch is an example of a product that contains a powerful opioid medicine that can be dangerous to people it’s not prescribed for. This adhesive patch delivers a strong pain medicine through the skin.\nEven after a patch is used, a lot of the medicine remains. That’s why the drug comes with instructions to flush used or leftover patches.\nDisposing Inhaler Products\nOne environmental concern involves inhalers used by people who have asthma or other breathing problems, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Read handling instructions on the labeling of inhalers and aerosol products.\nThese products could be dangerous if punctured or thrown into a fire or incinerator. To properly dispose of these products and follow local regulations and laws, contact your trash and recycling facility.\nFlushing Drugs and the Water Supply\nSome people wonder if it’s okay to flush certain medicines when a take back option is not easily available. There are concerns about the small levels of drugs that may be found in surface water, such as rivers and lakes, and in drinking water supplies.\n“The main way drug residues enter water systems is by people taking medicines and then naturally passing them through their bodies,” says Raanan Bloom, Ph.D., an environmental assessment expert at the FDA. “Many drugs are not completely absorbed or metabolized by the body and can enter the environment after passing through wastewater treatment plants.”\nThe FDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency take the concerns of flushing certain medicines in the environment seriously. Still, there has been no sign of environmental effects caused by flushing recommended drugs. In fact, the FDA published a paper to assess this concern, finding negligible risk of environmental effects caused by flushing recommended drugs.\nFor more information on what to do when you no longer need your medicines, visit this FDA page."

        "topic": "FDA Pharmacists Help You Use Medicines Safely",
        "content": "Español\nHow often has this happened to you: You pick up a prescription at the pharmacy and later realize you have questions about something in the directions or warnings. Or you buy a nonprescription drug but aren’t sure about the correct dosage after reading the label.\nThat’s where pharmacists come in. Whether at your local pharmacy or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, pharmacists help patients achieve the best possible outcome when taking drugs.\nPharmacists can help people take their medicine properly and continue to take it for as long as recommended. For example, they can answer questions about other drugs and foods that can cause an interaction and advise you to consult with your health care professional when your usual medication is unavailable.\nPharmacists are a bridge between the patient and their prescriber. They are experts at interpreting information for patients.\nWhat Your Pharmacist Should Know\n“Help your pharmacist get to know you and what questions you have,” says pharmacist Mary E. Kremzner, a public health expert at the FDA. “Pharmacists really want to help people get the maximum benefit from the drugs they need to take, with the least amount of risk.”\nFor example, some large pills are hard to swallow. “The pharmacist will know the drug’s makeup and whether you can crush it without changing how it works,” Kremzner says.\nAnother risk is interactions – food-drug or drug-drug. “For example, if you take a statin to lower your cholesterol, you might need to avoid drinking large amounts of grapefruit juice because it can make some drugs too powerful, even toxic,” says pharmacist Lindsay Wagner, a public health expert at the FDA. “However, the strength of the interaction varies among drugs. If grapefruit juice is part of your daily routine, your pharmacist can recommend that you consult with your health care professional about an alternative so you can enjoy your juice safely.”\nLet your pharmacist know what questions you have about the information you’ve received. This includes the instructions from your prescriber, information you received from the pharmacy, or articles you’ve read online. Conflicting advice and information can leave anyone confused.\nFalse information about medical products can add to the confusion. False information can be spread by people who don’t even know it is false, including people you know, like your friends and family. Pharmacists are there to help sort through what you’ve heard.\n“We’re here to help. We do our best to answer every question and help consumers find trustworthy and credible sources for information,” Wagner says.\nYour pharmacist should know:\n\nEverything you take for your health. All medications you take (prescription and nonprescription) as well as all vitamins and supplements.\nYour medical history and experience with medications, including allergic reactions and side effects.\nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding (nursing).\nIf you have trouble swallowing pills, opening bottles, reading labels, or remembering when to take your medicine.\nQuestions you have about what you’ve been told or read online about your medication.\n\nHow FDA Pharmacists Can Help\nCall your local pharmacist or the FDA’s drug information pharmacists if you have questions after receiving a medicine.\nThe FDA’s Division of Drug Information (DDI) is home to a staff of pharmacists who respond to questions about human drugs for the U.S. public. DDI gets several hundred calls and emails each day, with more than half of them from consumers.\nFDA pharmacists can even help you identify a tablet or pill. For example, there may be many different approved generics that can be substituted for one brand-name drug, and their tablets can look different.\n“Generic drugs can vary in size, shape, and color and still be the same medicine,” Kremzner says. “That can be confusing to some people. When in doubt, call your local pharmacist or the FDA if you have questions about whether they are the same product. We also can help you understand the medications you’re taking.”\nWhat Consumers Ask the FDA\nWhen in doubt, reach out to us and ask. Here are some of the top questions DDI pharmacists answer.\nQ. What are the possible side effects of my medicine, and how can I report my experience to the FDA?\nA. Approved drugs have benefits as well as side effects, which are listed in the drug’s labeling. If you didn’t receive a printout with your medication, you can find the labeling online from Drugs@FDA or labels.fda.gov.\nFor nonprescription drugs (also called over-the-counter, or OTC), you can find side effects in the “Drug Facts” labeling printed on the outer wrapper or container of the drug.\nTo report a side effect or medication error, use the FDA’s MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program:\n\nComplete and submit the report online.\nDownload the form or call 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form sent to you in the mail, then complete and return to the address on the form, or submit it by fax to 1-800-FDA-0178.\n\nQ. Where should I go to find information online about my medications and health?\nA. The FDA website fda.gov/drugs offers truthful, science-based information about prescription and nonprescription drugs. We also recommend MedlinePlus (medlineplus.gov), a service of the National Institutes of Health that provides health information for consumers.\nQ. Are generic drugs the same as brand-name drugs?\nA. Yes. Federal law requires generic drugs to be the same as brand-name drugs. They are as safe and effective and meet the same quality standards as brand-name drugs. They are the same in the way they work, the way they are taken, and the way they should be used. Generics also reach the site of action in the body at the same rate and extent as the brand-name drugs.\nQ. Will this treatment I read about online help or hurt me?\nA. You should be aware that there is false and misleading information about medical products online that can put patients and consumers at risk. For example, health fraud scams will try to sell you treatments that are not proven to work and may cause serious or even fatal injuries. Scams are very common today, especially on social media. If you’re unsure, ask your local pharmacist or health care professional, or contact the FDA.\nQ. How do I discard medicine I no longer need?\nA. The best way to dispose of most types of unused or expired medicines is to drop off the medicine at a drug take back location immediately. Many pharmacies also serve as take back locations.\nCertain medicines should be flushed down the sink or toilet because they are especially harmful and can cause death in a single dose. Flushing medicines on the flush list helps make sure children, pets, or anyone else does not accidentally take the medicine. If you can’t get to a take back location and your medication is not on the flush list, you may be able to dispose of it safely in your household trash by following some simple instructions.\nStay Informed and Get Updates from the FDA\nThe FDA shares information about drugs through email updates and social media. Stay informed by following the FDA’s official social media accounts, including:\n\nFacebook: facebook.com/FDA\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/FDA/\nX (formerly known as Twitter): @US_FDA and @FDA_Drug_Info (DDI’s handle)\n\nSubscribing to email alerts is easy, and there are many important topics.\nHow to Contact FDA’s Drug Information Pharmacists\n\nBy email: druginfo@fda.hhs.gov\nBy phone: 1-855-543-3784 and 1-301-796-3400"

FDA does not review or approve CMI, and the drug company does not review CMI.\n\nWhat are Medication Guides?\nA Medication Guide is patient labeling that is part of the FDA-approved prescription drug labeling for certain prescription drugs when the FDA determines that:\n\nPatient labeling could help prevent serious adverse reactions\nThe drug has serious risk(s) (relative to benefits) of which patients should be made aware because information concerning the risk(s) could affect patients' decision to use, or to continue to use, the product, or\nPatient adherence to directions for use is crucial to the drug’s effectiveness.\n\nMedication Guides (MGs) are developed by applicants, approved by FDA, and required to be distributed to patients. The medication guide shall be dispensed to the patient (or to the patient’s agent) in paper form when the product is dispensed; however, the patient may also request electronic delivery of the MG in lieu of the printed form.\nMG resources include:\n\nMG regulations available at 21 CFR 208\nMedication Guides - Distribution Requirements and Inclusion in Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) (final guidance)\nA guidance that has specific recommendations for the MG is the following:  Child-Resistant Packaging Statements in Drug Product Labeling (final guidance).\n\nBelow see an example MG template that provides a general overview of the MG (this MG does not contain any product-specific information). Consider using the enclosed Sample Template for Medication Guides when developing a Medication Guide (this sample template may not contain all the Medication Guide requirements or guidance recommendations).\n \n\n\nWhat are Patient Package Inserts?\nA Patient Package Insert (PPI), also known as “Patient Information” is patient labeling that can be part of the FDA-approved prescription drug labeling. Certain PPIs are developed by the manufacturer and approved by the FDA. \nPPIs are required for oral contraceptives and estrogen-containing products, and these PPIs are required to be dispensed with each prescription:\n\nPPIs for oral contraceptives (21 CFR 310.501)\nPPIs for estrogens (21 CFR 310.515)\n\nPPIs for other prescription drugs are submitted to the FDA voluntarily by the manufacturer and approved by the FDA, but their distribution is not mandated.\nA guidance that has specific recommendations for the PPI is the Child-Resistant Packaging Statements in Drug Product Labeling (final guidance).\nBelow see an example PPI template that provides a general overview of the PPI (this PPI does not contain any product-specific information).  The headings in this example PPI may not be applicable to all PPIs. Consider using the enclosed Sample Template for Patient Package Inserts when developing a PPI (this sample template may not contain all the PPI requirements or guidance recommendations).\n \n\n\nWhat are Instructions for Use?\nThe Instructions for Use (IFU) is patient labeling that can be part of FDA-approved prescription drug labeling for a biologics license application (BLA), a new drug application (NDA), or an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). The IFU is developed by applicants for patients (or their caregivers) who use prescription drugs that have complicated or detailed patient-use instructions. The IFU provides detailed, action-oriented, step-by-step written and visual instructions for the patient on how to use the drug including instructions on preparation, administration, handling, storage, and disposal.  The IFU is developed by the applicant, reviewed and approved by FDA, and provided to patients (or their caregivers) when the drug is dispensed.  Some IFUs are not approved by the FDA.  IFU resources include:\n\nInstructions for Use - Patient Labeling for Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products (final guidance)\nAn additional guidance that has specific recommendations for the IFU: Metered Dose Inhaler and Dry Powder Inhaler Drug Products - Quality Considerations (draft guidance)\n\nBelow see an example IFU template that provides a general overview of the IFU (this IFU does not contain any product-specific information).\n \n\n\nWhat is Patient Medication Information?\nFDA published a proposed rule, Medication Guides: Patient Medication Information in May 2023. Under the proposed rule, FDA is proposing to amend its human prescription drug labeling regulations to require a new type of Medication Guide — Patient Medication Information (PMI) — for prescription drugs used, dispensed, or administered on an outpatient basis, as well as for blood and blood components transfused in an outpatient setting. When the rule is finalized, PMI will:\n\nContain essential information that patients need to know about the prescription drug,\nBe an FDA-approved one-page document with standardized format and content requirements.\n\nFor additional information on the proposed PMI rule visit the Patient Medication Information webpage.\n\nContact Information\nFor specific application or supplement questions or for general questions about prescription drug labeling, please visit Prescription Drug Labeling Contact Information.\nFor general questions about patient labeling or this website please email CDEROMP@fda.hhs.gov."

These products raise questions and concerns for many consumers. And if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you might have even more questions about whether these products are safe for you.\nFDA strongly advises against the use of cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and marijuana in any form during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.\nWhat are cannabis, marijuana, hemp, THC and CBD?\nCannabis is a plant of the Cannabaceae family and contains more than eighty biologically active chemical compounds.

One type of cannabis plant is marijuana, which contains varying levels of THC, the compound that produces the “high” that is often associated with marijuana. Another type of cannabis plant is hemp. Hemp plants contain extremely low amounts of THC. CBD, which does not produce a “high,” can be derived from either marijuana or hemp.\nWe are now seeing CBD-containing products everywhere. CBD can be found in many different products, like drugs, foods, products marketed as dietary supplements, and cosmetics. These products often make questionable health promises about CBD.\nFDA wants you to know there may be serious risks to using cannabis products, including those containing CBD, if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nWhat do we know about the effects of marijuana use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding?\nThere are many potential negative health effects from using marijuana and other products containing THC during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. In fact, the U.S. Surgeon General recently advised consumers that marijuana use during pregnancy may affect fetal brain development, because THC can enter the fetal brain from the mother’s bloodstream. The Surgeon General also advised that marijuana may increase the risk of a newborn with low birth weight. Research also suggests increased risk for premature birth and potentially stillbirth1.\nWhile breastfeeding, it is important to know that breastmilk can contain THC for up to six days after use. This THC may affect a newborn’s brain development and result in hyperactivity, poor cognitive function, and other long-term consequences.\nAdditionally, marijuana smoke contains many of the same harmful components as tobacco smoke. Neither marijuana nor tobacco products should be smoked around a baby or children.\nWhat do we know about the effects of CBD use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding?\nThere is no comprehensive research studying the effects of CBD on the developing fetus, pregnant mother, or breastfed baby. FDA is continuing to collect and study the data on the possible harmful effects of CBD during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. However, based on what we do know, there is significant cause for concern.\nHigh doses of CBD in pregnant test animals have caused problems with the reproductive system of developing male fetuses2 . In addition, based on what we already know about CBD, we expect that some amount of CBD will be transferred to babies through breast milk.\nWe also know that there is a potential for CBD products to be contaminated with substances that may pose a risk to the fetus or breastfed baby, including THC. We have also heard reports of CBD potentially containing other contaminants (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals, bacteria, and fungus); we are investigating this.\nMoreover, CBD has known risks for people in general. Based on clinical studies in humans, risks can include the following:\n\nliver toxicity (damage)\nextreme sleepiness\nharmful interactions with other drugs\n\nFDA is studying the effects of CBD use from different angles, such as: (1) the use of CBD-containing products, like food, cosmetics, or supplements, over a person’s entire life; and (2) the effects of using these various products in combination. There are many unanswered questions about the science, safety, and quality of products containing CBD.\nWe especially want to learn more about the effects of CBD during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, including, for example, whether and to what extent the presence of CBD in human milk harms the breastfed baby or the mother’s milk production.\nHas FDA approved any CBD products and are there any benefits?\nFDA has not approved any CBD products except for one prescription drug to treat rare, severe forms of seizure disorders in children. It is still unclear whether CBD has any other benefits.\nOther than the one approved prescription drug, CBD products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for use as drug products. This means that we do not know:\n\nif they are safe and effective to treat a particular disease\nwhat, if any, dosage may be considered safe\nhow they could interact with other drugs or foods\nwhether they have dangerous side effects or other safety concerns\n\nThe clinical studies that supported the approval of the one available CBD drug product identified risks related to the use of CBD, including liver toxicity (damage), extreme sleepiness, and harmful interactions with other drugs.\nWhat about hemp seeds?\nFDA recently completed an evaluation of some hemp seed-derived food ingredients and had no objections to the use of these ingredients in foods. THC and CBD are found mainly in hemp flowers, leaves, and stems, not in hemp seeds. Hemp seeds can pick up miniscule amounts of THC and CBD from contact with other plant parts, but these amounts are low enough to not raise concerns for any group, including pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.\nWhat should you remember about using cannabis or cannabis-derived products?\nIf you are considering using cannabis, or any products containing THC or CBD, you should be aware of the following:\n\nFDA strongly advises that during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, you avoid using CBD, THC, or marijuana in any form.\nAlthough many of these products are being sold, FDA has not approved these products, other than one prescription CBD drug product and two prescription drug products containing dronabinol, a synthetic version of THC (which are approved to treat certain side effects of HIV-AIDS or chemotherapy). All three of these prescription products have associated risks and side effects.\nAlways talk with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist before taking any medicines, vitamins, or herbs while pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nDo not put yourself or your baby at risk by using cannabis products while pregnant or breastfeeding. Check out these links to learn more about cannabis, marijuana, CBD, and THC, and about taking medicines while you are pregnant.\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Products Containing Cannabis or Cannabis-derived Compounds, Including CBD\nMedicine and Pregnancy\nFDA Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabis-Derived Products: Questions and Answers\nU.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory: Marijuana Use and the Developing Brain\n\n\n\nhttps://drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/can-marijuana-use-during-pregnancy-harm-baby\nDalterio SL, deRooij DG.

People who are pregnant or breastfeeding often need to take prescription medications for pregnancy-related conditions, new short-term conditions, or medical conditions that require ongoing treatment, such as asthma, high blood pressure and depression.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that most people take at least one prescription medication at some point during pregnancy. In addition, more than half of people take a prescription medication in the months after delivery, according to the CDC.\nWhen the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves a prescription medication for adults, the drug is also approved for pregnant patients. But information about medication dosing during pregnancy and breastfeeding may not be available. For that and other reasons, it is important to discuss treatment options with your health care professional if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nPregnancy and Breastfeeding Labeling Updates\nLabeling for more than 2,200 prescription medications has been updated with the FDA’s revised pregnancy and breastfeeding labeling format since June 2015. Improving the quality and quantity of human data is necessary to enhance information in prescription medication labeling.\nIn turn, this information helps health care professionals and patients better understand the benefits and risks of prescription medications that people may use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The revised format, which the FDA finalized in the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule in 2014, aims to improve presentation of pregnancy and breastfeeding-related information.\nFDA’s Efforts to Increase Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Data\nEfforts are underway at the FDA to increase the availability of high-quality data for medications people take while they are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nIn April 2018, the FDA published a draft guidance on scientific and ethical considerations for including pregnant people in clinical trials. In 2019, the agency published two other draft guidance documents. The first relates to designing studies to collect safety data on pregnancy and infant outcomes, and the second relates to conducting studies to evaluate whether medications get into breast milk. The aim of these draft guidance documents, when finalized, is to improve the consistency and quality of pregnancy safety and breastfeeding studies.\nIn February 2021, the FDA and the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy held a workshop on scientific and ethical considerations for including pregnant people in clinical trials. Potential research participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding may not be aware of opportunities to join clinical trials.\nThe FDA’s Office of Women’s Health (OWH) provides a public listing of active pregnancy exposure registries to bring awareness of opportunities to participate in research for people who may be taking medications or received a vaccine while pregnant. In addition, OWH has a long history of funding research to expand our knowledge on medication use during pregnancy and lactation.\nOWH also has educational webinars focused on engaging providers to address knowledge gaps on medication use in pregnancy and lactation, and pregnancy and lactation medication information for health care providers, among others.\nThe FDA has also been an active participant in the federal Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women, which has developed recommendations and a plan to increase research to address gaps in knowledge on medication use in pregnancy and breastfeeding.\nWhile these large-scale efforts are underway, we understand that patients want answers now. Deciding which medication to take is a complex and personal decision that you should discuss with your health care professional.\nIf you are pregnant or nursing, talk with your health care professional about whether to enroll in pregnancy safety or breastfeeding studies. With your help and the assistance of researchers, drug manufacturers and health care professionals, the FDA aims to continue improving the information for medications."

        "content": "Imprimir y Compartir (PDF 1363KB)\nEn inglés\n¿Qué es la menopausia?\nLa menopausia es un cambio normal y natural en la vida de una mujer cuando su menstruación se detiene. Por eso algunas personas llaman a la menopausia “el cambio de vida” o “el cambio”. Durante la menopausia, el cuerpo de una mujer produce lentamente menos de las hormonas estrógeno y progesterona. Esto a menudo ocurre entre las edades de 45 y 55 años. Una mujer ha alcanzado la menopausia cuando no ha tenido un período por 12 meses seguidos.\n¿Cuáles son los síntomas de la menopausia?\nLa menstruación de cada mujer se detendrá durante la menopausia. Algunas mujeres pueden no tener ningún otro síntoma en absoluto. Cuando se acerca a la menopausia, puede tener:\n\nCambios en su menstruación – el tiempo entre períodos o el flujo pueden ser diferentes.\nSofocos – el calentamiento de la cara, el cuello o el pecho, con y sin sudoración.\nSudores nocturnos que pueden provocar problemas de dormir y sensaciones de cansancio, estrés o tensión.\nCambios vaginales – la vagina puede secarse y adelgazarse, y el sexo puede ser doloroso.\nAdelgazamiento de sus huesos, lo que puede conducir a la pérdida de altura y a las roturas de los huesos (osteoporosis).\n\n¿Quién necesita tratamiento para los síntomas de la menopausia?\n\nPara algunas mujeres, muchos de estos cambios desaparecerán con el tiempo sin tratamiento.\nAlgunas mujeres elegirán el tratamiento para sus síntomas y para prevenir la pérdida ósea. Si elige usar el tratamiento hormonal, puede ser utilizado el estrógeno solo o el estrógeno con progestina (para una mujer que todavía tiene su útero o matriz).\n\n¿Qué es la terapia hormonal para la menopausia?\nLos niveles hormonales bajos durante la menopausia pueden provocar sofocos, la sequedad vaginal y el adelgazamiento de los huesos. Para ayudar con estos problemas, a las mujeres se les puede recetar estrógeno o estrógeno con progestina (otra hormona). Como todos los medicamentos, la terapia hormonal tiene beneficios y riesgos. Hable con su médico, enfermera o farmacéutico sobre la terapia hormonal. Si decide usar la terapia hormonal, use la dosis más baja que le ayude. También use las hormonas por el tiempo más corto necesario.\n\n¿Quién no debe usar la terapia hormonal para la menopausia?\nLas mujeres que:\n\nPiensan que están embarazadas.\nTienen problemas de sangrado vaginal.\nTienen ciertos tipos de cáncer.\nHan tenido un derrame cerebral o un ataque cardíaco.\nHan tenido coágulos.\nTienen una enfermedad hepática.\n\n\n¿Cuáles son los beneficios de usar la terapia hormonal para la menopausia?\n\nLa terapia hormonal puede ayudar a aliviar los sofocos, los sudores nocturnos, la sequedad vaginal o la dispareunia (dolor con la actividad sexual).\nLas hormonas pueden reducir sus posibilidades de contraer huesos delgados y débiles (la osteoporosis), que se rompen fácilmente.\n\n¿Cuáles son los riesgos de usar la terapia hormonal?\nPara algunas mujeres, la terapia hormonal puede aumentar sus posibilidades de contraer coágulos, ataques cardíacos, derrames cerebrales, cáncer de seno y enfermedades de la vesícula. Para una mujer con útero, el estrógeno aumenta la posibilidad de contraer cáncer de endometrio (cáncer del revestimiento uterino). Agregar la progestina reduce este riesgo.\n¿Por cuánto tiempo debo usar la terapia hormonal para los síntomas de la menopausia?\n\nHable con su médico, enfermera o farmacéutico.\nEl tratamiento para los síntomas de la menopausia debe ser decidido con su proveedor de atención médica, ya que hay muchas hormonas diferentes aprobadas por la FDA para tratar los síntomas.\n\n¿Marca alguna diferencia qué tipo de hormonas uso para la menopausia?\nSi. La FDA recomienda que las mujeres usen las terapias hormonales aprobadas por la FDA. Las terapias hormonales aprobadas por la FDA se evalúan por seguridad y eficacia.\n¿Son las “hormonas bioidénticas” compuestas más seguras o efectivas para la menopausia que la terapia hormonal aprobada por la FDA?\nMuchos productos comercializados que se llaman “hormonas bioidénticas” son fármacos compuestos, que no están aprobados por la FDA. La FDA no tiene evidencia de que las “hormonas bioidénticas” son seguras y efectivas, o más seguras o efectivas que la terapia hormonal aprobada por la FDA.\nLa FDA ha aprobado fármacos que contienen hormonas que son idénticas a las hormonas producidas naturalmente por las mujeres en sus años reproductivos.\n¿Es la hormona estriol un “tipo de estrógeno más seguro”?\nLa FDA no tiene evidencia que los fármacos que contienen estriol son seguros y efectivos, o son “tipos de estrógeno más seguros”. No hay fármacos aprobados por la FDA que contengan estriol. Los fármacos comercializados que contienen estriol son fármacos compuestos, que no están aprobados por la FDA.\n¿Ha aprobado la FDA otros tratamientos para la menopausia?\nSi. En el 2013, la FDA aprobó:\n\nUn tratamiento no hormonal para sofocos moderados a severos asociados con la menopausia.\nUn medicamento para tratar la dispareunia (dolor con la actividad sexual) moderada a severa debida a cambios vaginales que ocurren con la menopausia.\n\n¿Son las hierbas y otros productos “naturales” útiles en el tratamiento de los síntomas de la menopausia?\nEn este momento, la FDA no sabe si las hierbas u otros productos “naturales” son útiles o seguros.\n\n¿Debo usar estrógeno solo para prevenir huesos delgados?\nSi puede, pero también hay otros medicamentos y cosas que puede hacer para ayudar a sus huesos. Hable con su proveedor de atención médica.\n¿Debo usar la terapia hormonal para proteger el corazón o prevenir derrames cerebrales?\nNo, no use la terapia hormonal para prevenir los ataques cardíacos o derrames cerebrales.\n¿Debo usar la terapia hormonal para prevenir la pérdida de memoria o la enfermedad de Alzheimer?\nNo, no use la terapia hormonal para prevenir la pérdida de memoria o la enfermedad de Alzheimer.\n¿Las hormonas protegen contra el envejecimiento y las arrugas, o aumentan mi deseo sexual?\nLos estudios no han mostrado que la terapia hormonal prevenga el envejecimiento y las arrugas, o que aumente el deseo sexual.\n\nPara más información:\nla Oficina de Salud de la Mujer de la FDA\nwww.fda.gov/menopause"

        "content": "What does this test do? This is a home-use test kit to measure Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) in your urine. This may help indicate if you are in menopause or perimenopause.What is menopause? Menopause is the stage in your life when menstruation stops for at least 12 months. The time before this is called perimenopause and could last for several years. You may reach menopause in your early 40's or as late as your 60's.What is FSH? Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hormone produced by your pituitary gland. FSH levels increase temporarily each month to stimulate your ovaries to produce eggs. When you enter menopause and your ovaries stop working, your FSH levels also increase.What type of test is this? This is a qualitative test -- you find out whether or not you have elevated FSH levels, not if you definitely are in menopause or perimenopause.Why should you do this test? You should use this test if you want to know if your symptoms, such as irregular periods, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or sleep problems are part of menopause. While many women may have little or no trouble when going through the stages of menopause, others may have moderate to severe discomfort and may want treatment to alleviate their symptoms. This test may help you be better informed about your current condition when you see your doctor.How accurate is this test? These tests will accurately detect FSH about 9 out of 10 times. This test does not detect menopause or perimenopause. As you grow older, your FSH levels may rise and fall during your menstrual cycle. While your hormone levels are changing, your ovaries continue to release eggs and you can still become pregnant.Your test will depend on whether youused your first morning urine,drank large amounts of water before the test,use, or recently stopped using, oral or patch contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, or estrogen supplements.How do you do this test? In this test, you put a few drops of your urine on a test device, put the end of the testing device in your urine stream, or dip the test device into a cup of urine. Chemicals in the test device react with FSH and produce a color. Read the instructions with the test you buy to learn exactly what to look for in this test.Are the home menopause tests similar to the ones my doctor uses? Some home menopause tests are identical to the one your doctor uses. However, doctors would not use this test by itself. Your doctor would use your medical history, physical exam, and other laboratory tests to get a more thorough assessment of your condition.Does a positive test mean you are in menopause? A positive test indicates that you may be in a stage of menopause. If you have a positive test, or if you have any symptoms of menopause, you should see your doctor. Do not stop taking contraceptives based on the results of these tests because they are not foolproof and you could become pregnant.Do negative test results indicate that you are not in menopause? If you have a negative test result, but you have symptoms of menopause, you may be in perimenopause or menopause. You should not assume that a negative test means you have not reached menopause, there could be other reasons for the negative result. You should always discuss your symptoms and your test results with your doctor. Do not use these tests to determine if you are fertile or can become pregnant. These tests will not give you a reliable answer on your ability to become pregnant.Useful Links:MedlinePlus: Menopause"

        "content": "For Immediate Release:\nMay 12, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nToday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Veozah (fezolinetant), an oral medication for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, or hot flashes, caused by menopause. Veozah is the first neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonist approved by the FDA to treat moderate to severe hot flashes from menopause. It works by binding to and blocking the activities of the NK3 receptor, which plays a role in the brain’s regulation of body temperature.\n“Hot flashes as a result of menopause can be a serious physical burden on women and impact their quality of life,” said Janet Maynard, M.D., M.H.S., director of the Office of Rare Diseases, Pediatrics, Urologic and Reproductive Medicine, in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “The introduction of a new molecule to treat moderate to severe menopausal hot flashes will provide an additional safe and effective treatment option for women.”\nMenopause is a normal, natural change in a woman’s life when her period stops, usually occurring between ages 45 and 55. Menopause is often referred to as “the change of life” or “the change.” During menopause a woman’s body slowly produces less of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. A woman has reached menopause when she has not had a menstrual period for 12 consecutive months. Hot flashes occur in around 80% of menopausal women and can include periods of sweating, flushing and chills lasting for several minutes.\nSome women who experience hot flashes and have a history of vaginal bleeding, stroke, heart attack, blood clots or liver disease, cannot take hormone therapies. Veozah is not a hormone. It targets the neural activity which causes hot flashes during menopause. \nPatients taking Veozah should take one 45 milligram pill orally, once a day, with or without food. The pill should be taken at the same time each day. If a dose is missed, or not taken at the regular time, patients should take it as soon as possible and return to their regular schedule the following day.\nThe effectiveness of Veozah to treat moderate to severe hot flashes was demonstrated in each of the first 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind portions of two phase 3 clinical trials. In both trials, after the first 12 weeks, the women on placebo were then re-randomized to Veozah for a 40-week extension study to evaluate safety. Each trial ran a total of 52 weeks. The average age of the trial participants was 54 years old.\nThe prescribing information for Veozah includes a warning for elevated hepatic transaminase, or liver injury. Before using Veozah, patients should have blood work done to test for liver damage. While on Veozah, routine bloodwork should be performed every three months for the first nine months of using the medication. Patients experiencing symptoms related to liver damage—such as nausea, vomiting, or yellowing of the skin and eyes—should contact a physician. Veozah cannot be used with CYP1A2 inhibitors. Patients with known cirrhosis, severe renal damage or end-stage renal disease should not take Veozah. \nThe most common side effects of Veozah include abdominal pain, diarrhea, insomnia, back pain, hot flush and elevated hepatic transaminases. \nThe FDA granted the Veozah application Priority Review designation.\nThe approval of Veozah was granted to Astellas Pharma US, Inc.\nRelated Information\n\nRelated Information\n\nMenopause\nMenopause & Hormones Common Questions\nOffice of Rare Diseases, Pediatrics, Urologic and Reproductive Medicine-Division of Urology, Obstetrics, and Gynecology (DUOG)\n\n\n\n###\n\n\nBoilerplate\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

        "content": "Español 药物安全通讯 Drug Safety Podcast\n\n09-12-2024 FDA Drug Safety Communication\n\nDrug Safety Communication (PDF - 189 KB)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat safety concern is FDA announcing?\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that Veozah (fezolinetant), a medicine used to treat hot flashes due to menopause, can cause rare but serious liver injury. If there are signs and symptoms suggesting liver injury, stopping the medicine could prevent worsening liver injury and potentially return liver function to normal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is FDA doing?\n\n\n\n\nWe added a warning about the risk of liver injury to the existing warning about elevated liver blood test values and required liver blood testing in the prescribing information for Veozah. We made this update after reviewing a postmarketing report of a patient with elevated liver blood test values and signs and symptoms of liver injury after taking the medicine for about 40 days. We also added new recommendations for patients and health care professionals about increasing the frequency of liver blood testing, adding monthly testing for the next 2 months after starting Veozah, and then at months 3, 6, and 9 of treatment as already recommended. The updated prescribing information also instructs patients to stop the medicine immediately and contact the health care professional who prescribed the medicine if signs and symptoms of liver injury occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Veozah (fezolinetant) and how can it help me?\n\n\n\n\nVeozah (fezolinetant) is a nonhormonal prescription medicine approved in May 2023 to reduce the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes caused by menopause. The medicine is in a drug class called neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonists. It works to restore the balance between estrogen hormones and a brain chemical called neurokinin B (NKB) by blocking the activities of the NK3 receptor, which plays a role in the brain’s control of body temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should patients and parents/caregivers do?\n\n\n\n\nPatients should stop taking Veozah immediately and contact your health care professional who prescribed the medicine if you experience signs and symptoms that suggest liver problems. These include feeling more tired than usual; nausea; vomiting; unusual itching; light-colored stools; yellowing of the eyes or skin, called jaundice; dark urine; swelling in the stomach or belly area, called the abdomen; or pain in the right upper abdomen. Your health care professional will do blood tests before starting Veozah and during treatment to check and monitor how well your liver is working. Talk to your health care professional about the risks and benefits of taking Veozah and discuss any questions or concerns you may have, including about possible alternative treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should health care professionals do?\n\n\n\n\nHealth care professionals should conduct hepatic laboratory testing before prescribing Veozah, then every month for the first three months after patients start treatment, and then at months 6 and 9 of treatment. When prescribing Veozah, inform patients about the risk of elevated liver blood test values that may occur during treatment and the rare but serious risk of liver injury, and advise them of the need for regular liver blood testing. Discuss the signs and symptoms of liver injury and instruct patients to stop Veozah immediately and contact the health care professional who prescribed the medicine if they develop these any time during treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did FDA find?\n\n\n\n\nWe reviewed a postmarketing case* of serious liver injury in a patient who experienced symptoms of fatigue, nausea, itching, yellow eyes and skin, light-colored stools, and dark urine within 40 days of starting Veozah. The patient’s liver blood test values were elevated, including abnormal liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. After stopping the medicine, the patient’s symptoms gradually went away, and blood test values slowly returned to normal.\n\n*The case was reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is my risk?\n\n\n\n\nAll medicines have side effects even when used correctly as prescribed. It is important to know that people respond differently to all medicines depending on their health, the diseases they have, genetic factors, other medicines they are taking, and many other factors. As a result, we cannot determine how likely it is that someone will experience these side effects when taking Veozah (fezolinetant). Your health care professionals know you best, so talk to them if you have questions or concerns about risks of taking Veozah (fezolinetant).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I report side effects from Veozah (fezolinetant)?\n\n\n\n\nTo help FDA track safety issues with medicines, we urge patients and health care professionals to report side effects involving Veozah (fezolinetant) or other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program using the information in the “Contact FDA” box at the bottom of this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I get new safety information on medicines I’m prescribing or taking?\n\n\n\n\nYou can sign up for email alerts about Drug Safety Communications on medicines or medical specialties of interest to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts about Veozah (fezolinetant)\n\n\n\n\n\nVeozah is a nonhormonal prescription medicine approved by FDA to reduce moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause.  It is in the class of medicines called neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonists.\nVeozah works to restore the balance between estrogen hormones and a brain chemical called neurokinin B (NKB) by blocking the activities of the NK3 receptor, which plays a role in the brain’s regulation of body temperature.\nVeozah is available as a tablet taken by mouth once daily.\nCommon side effects include stomach pain, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, back pain, hot flashes, or hot flushes.\nVeozah use in the U.S. has steadily increased since approval in May 2023. In May 2024, an estimated 28,700 patients were dispensed Veozah from U.S. outpatient retail pharmacies.i\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information for Patients\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA is warning that Veozah (fezolinetant), a medicine used to treat moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause, can cause rare but serious liver injury and we added a warning about this rare but serious risk of liver injury in the prescribing information for the medicine.\nStop taking Veozah immediately and  contact your health professional who prescribed the medicine if you experience signs and symptoms that suggest liver problems.  These may include feeling more tired than usual; nausea; vomiting; unusual itching; light-colored stools; yellowing of the eyes or skin, called jaundice; dark urine; swelling in the stomach or belly area, called the abdomen; or pain in the right upper abdomen. Stopping the medicine if there are signs and symptoms that suggest liver injury could prevent worsening liver injury and potentially return liver function to normal.\nBefore prescribing Veozah, health care professionals will do blood tests to check and monitor how well your liver is working. Health care professionals will also do these blood tests every month for the first 3 months after you start taking the medicine, and then again at 6 and 9 months of treatment.  If liver blood test values are elevated, the health care professional may advise you to stop treatment or request additional blood tests.\nRead the patient information leaflet you receive from the pharmacy every time you receive a prescription for Veozah (fezolinetant) because there may be new or important additional information about the medicine.  The patient information leaflet explains the important things you need to know about the medicine.  These include the side effects, what the medicine is used for, how to take and store it properly, and other things to watch out for when you are taking the medicine.\nFor more information about menopause and how to treat the symptoms, visit the following FDA website on Menopause.\nTo help FDA track safety issues with medicines, report side effects from Veozah (fezolinetant) or other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program using the information in the “Contact FDA” box at the bottom of this page.\nYou can sign up for email alerts about Drug Safety Communications on medicines and medical specialties of interest to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information for Health Care Professionals\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA is warning that Veozah (fezolinetant) used to treat moderate to severe hot flashes due to menopause can cause rare but serious liver injury. If there are signs and symptoms suggesting liver injury, stopping the medicine could prevent worsening liver injury and potentially return liver function to normal.\nFDA added a warning about the risk of liver injury to the existing warning about elevated liver blood test values in the prescribing information for Veozah.  We made this update after reviewing a postmarketing case about a patient with increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin and signs and symptoms of liver injury within 40 days of starting it.  After stopping the medicine, the patient’s symptoms gradually resolved, and blood test values slowly returned to normal.\nSteps to reduce the risk of liver injury cited in the prescribing information include the following.\nBefore starting Veozah, perform baseline liver blood tests to assess liver function, including serum ALT, serum AST, serum ALP, and serum bilirubin (total and direct).   During treatment, perform follow-up liver blood tests every month for the first three months, and then again at months 6 and 9 of treatment.\nDo not start Veozah if the concentration of ALT, AST, or total bilirubin is equal to or exceeds two times the upper limit of normal (ULN).\nStop Veozah if transaminases exceed five times the ULN, or if transaminases exceed three times the ULN and total bilirubin is more than two times the ULN.\nPerform more frequent follow-up liver blood tests if the transaminases exceed three times the ULN, but the total bilirubin is not more than two times the ULN.  If the liver blood test values are elevated, exclude alternative causes of liver injury.\nInform patients about the risk of elevated liver blood test values during treatment and the rare but serious risk of liver injury, and discuss the need for regular liver test monitoring.\nExplain the signs and symptoms of liver problems to patients and instruct them to stop taking Veozah immediately and contact the health care professional who prescribed the medicine if they develop these symptoms and signs any time during treatment with Veozah.\nEncourage patients to read the patient information leaflet they receive with their Veozah (fezolinetant) prescriptions because there may be new or important additional information about the medicine.\nTo help FDA track safety issues with medicines, report adverse events involving Veozah (fezolinetant) or other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program using the information in the “Contact FDA” box at the bottom of this page.\nYou can sign up for email alerts about Drug Safety Communications on medicines and medical specialties of interest to you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Summary\n\n\n\n\nFDA reviewed a postmarketing case of serious drug-induced liver injury that occurred in a patient who received Veozah to treat menopausal hot flashes caused. Before starting Veozah, the patient’s liver blood test levels were normal. Within 40 days of starting it, several liver blood test values were significantly elevated: alanine transaminase, more than 10 times of normal level; alkaline phosphatase, more than four times of normal level; and total bilirubin, more than 3 times of normal level. The patient reported symptoms of liver injury, including fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, itching of hands and feet that later spread to the entire body, jaundice, pale feces, and dark urine. The patient’s prescriber found no abnormalities when checking for other causes of liver injury, using ultrasonography of the liver and blood tests for viral hepatitis. With discontinuation of Veozah, the signs and symptoms gradually resolved, and liver blood test values returned to normal. We concluded this patient had liver injury as a result of Veozah treatment.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ni IQVIA Total Patient Tracker™. Available at www.iqvia.com.

        "content": "Print and Share (PDF 3557 KB)\nMenopause (sometimes called “the change of life”) is a normal time in a woman’s life when her period stops. During menopause, a woman’s body makes less of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Lower hormone levels may lead to symptoms like night sweats, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness along with thin bones.\nSome women choose to treat their menopause symptoms with hormone medicines sometimes called Hormone Therapy. The following lists some basic information about the FDA-approved hormone medicines for menopause. Use this information to help you talk to your healthcare provider about whether hormone medicines are right for you.\nDo not take hormone therapy if you:\n\nhave problems with vaginal bleeding\nhave or have had certain cancers such as breast cancer or uterine cancer\nhave or have had a blood clot, stroke or heart attack\nhave a bleeding disorder\nhave liver disease\nhave allergic reactions to hormone medicine\n\n\nMenopause Hormone Therapy\nThere are different types of hormone medicines used during and after menopause:\n\nEstrogen-Only Medicines\nProgestin-Only Medicines \nCombination Estrogen and Progestin Medicines\nCombination Estrogen and Other Medicines\n\nInformation about non-hormone medicines for menopause is not included. Ask your healthcare provider about the FDA-approved non-hormone medicine for menopause called Brisdelle (paroxetine).\n\nSide Effects\nHormone medicines have side effects. Serious health problems can happen in women who take menopause hormone therapy.\n\nFor some women, hormone medicines may raise their chances of blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, and breast cancer.\nFor some women who are 65 years old or older, hormone medicines may raise their chances of dementia.\nFor women who still have their uterus, taking estrogen-only medicines raises their chance of getting cancer of the lining of the uterus or endometrial cancer. These women need to take progestin to prevent endometrial cancer.\n\nAll side effects and warnings for each hormone medicine are not listed.

Each NWHW, FDA Office of Women’s Health (OWH) celebrates women and their health by highlighting important health topics that impact women of all ages. \nThis year FDA OWH’s theme is Know Your Bones, to encourage women to take control of their health by learning about bone health including preventing and managing osteoporosis—a disease that causes very weak bones that break easily.\nThroughout NWHW, OWH will be sharing information to help you Know Your Bones. Check out our National Women's Health Week (NWHW) webpage for more information on our NWHW activities.\n \n\nBone health is often overlooked until problems arise. It doesn’t matter how old you are. You can take steps now to Know Your Bones.\nWhy bone health matters for women\nWomen are at higher risk of developing osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is about four times more common in women than men. Women are more likely to get osteoporosis because of:\n\nHormonal changes: Estrogen, a hormone that helps maintain bone density decreases after menopause. \nBody size: Slender, thin-boned women are at greater risk of developing osteoporosis.\nAging: Women often live longer than men. Bone loss happens naturally as we age.\n\nOsteoporosis is most common in older women, but younger women can also get osteoporosis. Girls and women of all ages need to take steps to protect and maintain their bones. There are tests that use either X-rays or ultrasound (sound waves) to measure bone density and can help determine if you have osteoporosis. Health care providers may recommend osteoporosis screening for women aged 65 and older, or earlier for women with specific risk factors. \nPrioritizing bone health at every age\n \n\nAdolescence and young adulthood: Building strong bones during childhood and the teen years is important to help prevent osteoporosis later in life. Participate in regular physical activity including weight bearing exercises like yoga or walking and eat a calcium-rich diet with foods like dairy products, leafy greens and calcium fortified foods. \nChildbearing years: Having a baby can be a joyous time but can also be demanding on the body. While in the womb, fetuses get their nutrients from their mother. If you don't get enough calcium from food or supplements, your fetus will use the calcium in your bones. Prenatal vitamins often contain calcium and vitamin D, which are important for both the mother and the fetus’s bone health. Your body also makes more of the hormone estrogen during pregnancy, which helps protect bones. You may lose some bone density during pregnancy and with breastfeeding, but any bone mass lost is temporary and usually restored after childbirth or after breastfeeding.\nPerimenopause and menopause: As estrogen levels decline, women are at an increased risk of bone loss. Weight bearing exercise and getting adequate calcium and vitamin D may help. Osteoporosis screening is recommended for women younger than 65 who have risk factors for osteoporosis such as a family history of osteoporosis or who take certain medicines to treat long-term health problems. Talk with your health care provider about whether you need to be screened for osteoporosis. If you are found to have osteoporosis, your provider may recommend medicine to prevent more bone loss or build new bone mass.\nPost-menopause: Continue to prioritize your bone health post-menopause to maintain bone strength and reduce the risk of fractures. Physical activity and diet are vital to bone health in older adults. Talk with your health care provider about osteoporosis screening, lifestyle changes, and possibly treatments to prevent more bone loss, help keep your bones strong or build new bone mass. \nThere is no way to cure osteoporosis. If you have been diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are prescription medicines you can take. Talk with your health care provider about your treatment options.\nNutrition and bone health \n \n\nNutrition can affect your bones. Not getting enough calcium, vitamin D and other important nutrients, may lead to weak bones. Eating disorders can affect bone and health because the body may not be getting the energy and nutrients it needs to stay healthy and strong. \nPeople experiencing eating disorders like anorexia greatly reduce the number of calories and nutrients they consume, which can prevent important growing and healing processes from taking place. In girls and young women, lack of proper nutrition is especially harmful to bone health, as bones may not grow as dense or as strong as they should. Learn more about the effects of nutrition on bone health.\n5 tips for maintaining strong bones\n\nEat a balanced diet. Get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet.\nStay physically active. Engage in weight bearing exercise like walking.\nAvoid smoking and excessive alcohol use. \nGet regular check-ups.\nTalk with your health care provider about your health care concerns and if you need osteoporosis screening before age 65. \n\nThis NWHW take time to Know Your Bones. It’s never too early or too late to make bone health a priority. By prioritizing bone health, you can build and preserve strong bones. \n\nDOWNLOAD - NWHW 2024 Social Media Partner Toolkit which focuses on bone health and osteoporosis.

        "content": "The FDA issued new information about this safety issue, see the FDA Drug Safety Communication issued on 1-19-2024. \n\t\n\nEn Español\nIn Chinese\nDrug Safety Communication (PDF - 166 KB)\n11-22-2022 FDA Drug Safety Communication\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is investigating the risk of severe hypocalcemia with serious outcomes, including hospitalization and death, in patients with advanced kidney disease on dialysis treated with the osteoporosis medicine Prolia (denosumab). Our review of interim results from an ongoing safety study of Prolia suggests an increased risk of hypocalcemia, or low calcium levels in the blood, in patients with advanced kidney disease. Preliminary results from a separate internal FDA study further investigating hypocalcemia in dialysis patients treated with Prolia show a substantial risk with serious outcomes, including hospitalization and death.\nBecause of the frequency and seriousness of these risks, we are alerting health care professionals and patients about them and that we are continuing to evaluate this potential safety issue with Prolia use in patients with advanced kidney disease, particularly those on dialysis. We will communicate our final conclusions and recommendations when we have completed our review or have more information to share.\nPatients should not stop Prolia treatment without first consulting your health care professional, as stopping may worsen your bone condition. Talk to your health care professional about any concerns you may have, including possible alternative treatments. Tell your health care professional if you experience any symptoms of low blood calcium levels such as unusual tingling or numbness in the hands, arms, legs, or feet; painful muscle spasms or cramps; voice box or lung spasms causing difficulty breathing; vomiting; seizures; or irregular heart rhythm.\nHealth care professionals should consider the risks of hypocalcemia with the use of Prolia in patients on dialysis. When Prolia is used in these patients, adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation and frequent blood calcium monitoring, possibly more often than is already being conducted, may help decrease the likelihood or severity of these risks. Advise patients on dialysis to immediately seek help if they experience symptoms of hypocalcemia.\nProlia is a prescription medicine approved in June 2010 to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for bone fracture. Prolia was later approved to treat men with osteoporosis, glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis, bone loss in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer and in women receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer. Prolia works by blocking a protein called RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta) and helps prevent bone cells called osteoclasts from breaking down bone in the body. A health care professional administers Prolia by injection once every six months.\nWhen FDA first approved Prolia, we required the manufacturer, Amgen, to conduct a long-term safety study in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and men with osteoporosis. Our review of the interim results from this ongoing safety study suggests an increased risk of hypocalcemia with Prolia in patients with advanced kidney disease. In addition, adverse event reports submitted to FDA showed severe and symptomatic hypocalcemia, including hospitalization and death, is occurring in patients with advanced kidney disease treated with Prolia. Preliminary results from a separate internal FDA study investigating the risk of hypocalcemia suggest that patients on dialysis treated with Prolia are at substantial risk for severe and symptomatic hypocalcemia, including hospitalization and death.\nWe urge health care professionals and patients to report side effects involving Prolia or other medicines to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the “Contact FDA” box at the bottom of the page.\nHealth care professionals, patients, and consumers can sign up for email alerts about Drug Safety Communications on medicines or medical specialties of interest to you.\nRelated Information\n\nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases: Osteoporosis Overview\nHypocalcemia\nThe FDA's Drug Review Process: Ensuring Drugs Are Safe and Effective\nThink It Through: Managing the Benefits and Risks of Medicines"

        "topic": "FDA approves new treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture",
        "content": "For Immediate Release:\nApril 09, 2019\n\n\n\nEspañol\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Evenity (romosozumab-aqqg) to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of breaking a bone (fracture). These are women with a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture, or those who have failed or are intolerant to other osteoporosis therapies.\nMore than 10 million people in the U.S. have osteoporosis, which is most common in women who have gone through menopause. People with osteoporosis have weakened bones that are more likely to fracture.\n“Today’s approval provides women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture with a new treatment that will reduce this risk,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D, M.M.Sc., director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research’s Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products. “But Evenity may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death so it’s important to carefully select patients for this therapy, which includes avoiding use in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year.”\nEvenity is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the protein sclerostin and works mainly by increasing new bone formation. One dose of Evenity consists of two injections, one immediately following the other, given once a month by a health care professional. The bone forming effect of Evenity wanes after 12 doses so more than 12 doses should not be used. If osteoporosis therapy is needed after the 12 doses, patients should begin an osteoporosis treatment that reduces bone breakdown.\nThe safety and efficacy of Evenity were demonstrated in two clinical trials involving a total of more than 11,000 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In the first trial, one year of treatment with Evenity lowered the risk of a new fracture in the spine (vertebral fracture) by 73% compared to placebo. This benefit was maintained over the second year of the trial when Evenity was followed by one year of denosumab (another osteoporosis therapy) compared to placebo followed by denosumab. In the second trial, one year of treatment with Evenity followed by one year of alendronate (another osteoporosis therapy) reduced the risk of a new vertebral fracture by 50% compared to two years of alendronate alone. Evenity followed by alendronate also reduced the risk of fractures in other bones (nonvertebral fractures) compared to alendronate alone.\nEvenity increased the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in the alendronate trial, but not in the placebo trial. Therefore, Evenity contains a boxed warning on its labeling stating that it may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death and should not be used in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year. Health care professionals should also consider whether the benefits of Evenity outweigh its risks in those with other risk factors for heart disease and should discontinue Evenity in any patient who experiences a heart attack or stroke during treatment.\nCommon side effects of Evenity included joint pain and headache. Injection site reactions were also observed.\nThe FDA granted the approval of Evenity to Amgen.\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency is also responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.\nRelated Information\n\nRelated Information\n\nOsteoporosis: Common treatments\nHow Long Should You Take Certain Osteoporosis Drugs?\n\n\n\n###\n\n\nInquiries\n\n\n\nMedia:\n\n\n Lyndsay Meyer\n\n\n 240-402-5345\n            \n\n\n\n\nConsumer:\n 888-INFO-FDA"

Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg fails to reach the womb, but instead begins to grow outside of the womb. This serious condition almost always results in death of the unborn child, and in some cases, death of the mother as well.\nAdditionally, there is some evidence that smoking during pregnancy may result in miscarriage of the fetus or unborn baby.2\nNo tobacco product is safe to use during pregnancy. Nearly all tobacco products—including most e-cigarettes—contain nicotine, which can cross the placenta and interfere with fetal and postnatal development.5\nIf you’re pregnant and interested in quitting smoking, consult with your health care provider to talk about your reproductive health. You can also get free resources for quitting while pregnant, including a texting program to offer support for pregnant people trying to quit.\n\nCan Smoking Put Me at Risk for Cervical Cancer? \nYes, smoking cigarettes can cause cervical cancer.1 This type of cancer occurs in the cervix, the lower, narrow end of the uterus that forms a canal between the uterus and vagina.\nWithin just a few years of quitting smoking, risk of cervical cancer is reduced.1 If you use tobacco and want to quit, there are resources that can help you quit smoking. \n\nCan Smoking Put Me at Risk for Erectile Dysfunction?\nYes, smoking can increase your risk for erectile dysfunction,3 a condition in which you are unable to get or keep an erection firm enough for satisfactory sexual intercourse.  \n\nCan Smoking Increase My Likelihood of Dying From Prostate Cancer? \nYes, smoking can increase your likelihood of dying from prostate cancer.3 The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system and produces a fluid that forms part of the semen. Prostate cancer begins in the prostate.\nIf you have prostate cancer and smoke, you may be more likely to die from the disease than those with prostate cancer who don’t smoke.3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS).

Healthy eating patterns include foods that provide vitamins, minerals, and other health-promoting components and have no or little added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.\n\n\n\nHealthy eating patterns that include fish may have other benefits too. Moderate scientific evidence shows that eating patterns relatively higher in fish but also in other foods, including vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy, lean meats and poultry, nuts, and unsaturated vegetable oils, and lower in red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, and refined grains are associated with:\n\nPromotion of bone health – decreases the risk for hip fractures*\nDecreases in the risk of becoming overweight or obese*\nDecreases in the risk for colon and rectal cancers*\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating fish as part of a healthy eating pattern.\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends:\n\nAt least 8 ounces of seafood (less for children§) per week based on a 2,000 calorie diet.\nThose who are pregnant or breastfeeding consume between 8 and 12 ounces per week of a variety of seafood from choices that are lower in mercury.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChoose a variety of fish that are lower in mercury.\nWhile it is important to limit mercury in the diets of those who are pregnant or breastfeeding and children, many types of fish are both nutritious and lower in mercury.  \nThis chart can help you choose which fish to eat, and how often to eat them, based on their mercury levels.\n\nWhat is a serving?

        "topic": "Learn about Listeria (Listeriosis)",
        "content": "Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is a species of pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria that can be found in moist environments, soil, water, decaying vegetation and animals, and can survive and even grow under refrigeration and other food preservation measures. When people eat food contaminated with L. monocytogenes, they may develop a disease called listeriosis.\nL. monocytogenes is generally transmitted when food is harvested, processed, prepared, packed, transported or stored in environments contaminated with L. monocytogenes. Environments can be contaminated by raw materials, water, soil, and incoming air. Pets can also spread the bacteria in the home environment if they eat food contaminated with L. monocytogenes.\nSymptoms\nThere are a range of symptoms for listeriosis. Depending on the severity of the illness, symptoms may last from days to several weeks. Mild symptoms may include a fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If the more severe form of listeriosis develops, symptoms may include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions. For the very young, the elderly, and the immune-compromised listeriosis can result in death.\nPeople infected with L. monocytogenes may start to see symptoms in a few hours or as long as two to three days after eating contaminated food. More severe forms of listeriosis may take anywhere from three days to three months to develop.\nDue to the range in severity of illness, people should consult their health care provider if they suspect that they have developed symptoms that resemble a(n) L. monocytogenes infection.\nAt-Risk Groups\nThe severity of listeriosis varies and in some cases can be fatal, especially among the elderly, people with weakened immune systems or chronic diseases.\nListeriosis can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women and their newborn babies, leading to serious complications with their pregnancy, including miscarriage and stillbirth. Babies born with a listeriosis infection may develop severe health complications that require immediate medical attention, lead to lifelong health problems, or result in death. Women who suspect they have symptoms of listeriosis (muscles aches, nausea, stiffness in neck, headaches, etc.) should seek medical care immediately and tell their health provider what they ate. Learn more about People at Risk of Foodborne Illness.\nFoods Linked to U.S. Outbreaks of Listeriosis\nPast listeriosis outbreaks in the U.S. have been linked to raw, unpasteurized milks and cheeses, ice cream, raw or processed vegetables, raw or processed fruits, raw or undercooked poultry, sausages, hot dogs, deli meats, and raw or smoked fish and other seafood. L. monocytogenes has also been found in raw pet food.\nPreventing Foodborne Illness at Home \nThe longer ready-to-eat refrigerated foods contaminated with L. monocytogenes are stored in the refrigerator, the more opportunity this pathogen has to grow. To slow down or prevent the growth of L. monocytogenes, set the refrigerator to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius), and the freezer to 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).\nConsumers should also follow these simple steps:\n\nWash the inside walls and shelves of the refrigerator, cutting boards and countertops, and utensils that may have contacted contaminated foods; then sanitize them with a solution of one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to one gallon of hot water; dry with a clean cloth or paper towel that has not been previously used. \nWipe up spills in the refrigerator immediately and clean the refrigerator regularly.\nWash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food and following any cleaning and sanitation process.\nPregnant women, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems should avoid certain foods, including unpasteurized or raw milk, cheeses made from unpasteurized milk, raw fish raw sprouts and some other raw foods, which carry a high risk for L. monocytogenes.\nPeople with pets should take special care to avoid cross-contamination when preparing their pet’s food. Be sure to pick up and thoroughly wash food dishes as soon as pets are done eating, and prevent children, the elderly, and any other people with weak immune systems from handling or being exposed to the food or pets that have eaten potentially contaminated food.\nConsumers can also submit a voluntarily report, a complaint, or adverse event (illness or serious allergic reaction) related to a food product.\n\nAdvice for Restaurants and Retailers\nRetailers and/or other food service operators who have handled recalled or other potentially contaminated food in their facilities should:\n\nContact their local health department and communicate to their customers regarding possible exposure to L. monocytogenes.\nTo prevent the growth of L. monocytogenes, set the refrigerator to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius), and set the freezer to 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).\nWash the inside walls and shelves of the refrigerator, cutting boards and countertops, and utensils that may have contacted contaminated foods; then sanitize them with a solution of one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to one gallon of hot water; dry with a clean cloth or paper towel that has not been previously used.\nWash and sanitize display cases and surfaces used to potentially store, serve, or prepare potentially contaminated foods.\nWash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process.\nConduct regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of cutting boards and utensils used in processing to help minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination. \n\nUnlike most bacteria, L. monocytogenes can grow at refrigeration temperatures and freezing will not eliminate or reduce the pathogen. The FDA recommends that retailers implement time and temperature controls to reduce the opportunity for the growth of L. monocytogenes.  L. monocytogenes can also cross-contaminate other food that has been cut and served on the same cutting board or stored in the same area. Retailers should check with your state for specific guidance.

        "content": "Description\nUses \nBenefits/Risks \nInformation for Patients including Expectant Mothers \nInformation for Health Care Providers \nInformation for Practices Conducting Ultrasound Imaging \nInformation for Industry \nReporting Problems to the FDA  \nOther Resources \n\n\nDescription\nUltrasound imaging (sonography) uses high-frequency sound waves to view inside the body. Because ultrasound images are captured in real-time, they can also show movement of the body's internal organs as well as blood flowing through the blood vessels. Unlike X-ray imaging, there is no ionizing radiation exposure associated with ultrasound imaging.\nIn an ultrasound exam, a transducer (probe) is placed directly on the skin or inside a body opening. A thin layer of gel is applied to the skin so that the ultrasound waves are transmitted from the transducer through the gel into the body.\n \n\nPicture of a transducer (probe) used during an ultrasound exam.\nThe ultrasound image is produced based on the reflection of the waves off of the body structures. The strength (amplitude) of the sound signal and the time it takes for the wave to travel through the body provide the information necessary to produce an image.\nUses\nUltrasound imaging is a medical tool that can help a physician evaluate, diagnose and treat medical conditions. Common ultrasound imaging procedures include:\n\nAbdominal ultrasound (to visualize abdominal tissues and organs)\nBone sonometry (to assess bone fragility)\nBreast ultrasound (to visualize breast tissue)\nDoppler fetal heart rate monitors (to listen to the fetal heart beat)\nDoppler ultrasound (to visualize blood flow through a blood vessel, organs, or other structures)\nEchocardiogram (to view the heart)\nFetal ultrasound (to view the fetus in pregnancy)\nUltrasound-guided biopsies (to collect a sample of tissue)\nOphthalmic ultrasound (to visualize ocular structures\nUltrasound-guided needle placement (in blood vessels or other tissues of interest)\n\nBenefits/Risks\nUltrasound imaging has been used for over 20 years and has an excellent safety record. It is based on non-ionizing radiation, so it does not have the same risks as X-rays or other types of imaging systems that use ionizing radiation.\nAlthough ultrasound imaging is generally considered safe when used prudently by appropriately trained health care providers, ultrasound energy has the potential to produce biological effects on the body. Ultrasound waves can heat the tissues slightly. In some cases, it can also produce small pockets of gas in body fluids or tissues (cavitation). The long-term consequences of these effects are still unknown. Because of the particular concern for effects on the fetus, organizations such as the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine have advocated prudent use of ultrasound imaging in pregnancy. Furthermore, the use of ultrasound solely for non-medical purposes such as obtaining fetal ‘keepsake’ videos has been discouraged. Keepsake images or videos are reasonable if they are produced during a medically-indicated exam, and if no additional exposure is required.\nInformation for Patients including Expectant Mothers\nFor all medical imaging procedures, the FDA recommends that patients talk to their health care provider to understand the reason for the examination, the medical information that will be obtained, the potential risks, and how the results will be used to manage the medical condition or pregnancy. Because ultrasound is not based on ionizing radiation, it is particularly useful for women of child-bearing age when CT or other imaging methods would otherwise result in exposure to radiation.\nExpectant Mothers\n \n\nUltrasound is the most widely used medical imaging method for viewing the fetus during pregnancy. Routine examinations are performed to assess and monitor the health status of the fetus and mother. Ultrasound examinations provide parents with a valuable opportunity to view and hear the heartbeat of the fetus, bond with the unborn baby, and capture images to share with family and friends.\n\nIn fetal ultrasound, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound allows the visualization of some facial features and possibly other parts such as fingers and toes of the fetus. Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound is 3D ultrasound in motion. While ultrasound is generally considered to be safe with very low risks, the risks may increase with unnecessary prolonged exposure to ultrasound energy, or when untrained users operate the device.\nExpectant mothers should also be aware of concerns with purchasing over-the-counter fetal heartbeat monitoring systems (also called doptones). These devices should only be used by trained health care providers when medically necessary. Use of these devices by untrained persons could expose the fetus to prolonged and unsafe energy levels, or could provide information that is interpreted incorrectly by the user.\nAdditional resources on ultrasound imaging:\n\nRadiologyInfo.org: Obstetrical Ultrasound\nImage Gently: The Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging\n\nInformation for Health Care Providers\nAs part of FDA’s Initiative To Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure From Medical Imaging, FDA has recommended that health care providers consider examinations that use little or no ionizing radiation exposure, such as ultrasound or MRI, if medically appropriate. Ultrasound imaging does introduce energy into the body, and laboratory studies have shown that diagnostic levels of ultrasound can produce physical effects in tissue, such as pressure oscillations with subsequent mechanical effects and rise in temperature. Therefore, FDA recommends that health care providers consider ways to minimize exposure while maintaining diagnostic quality when using ultrasound. As with all other imaging modalities, the principles of As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) should be practiced by health care providers.\nIndividual states regulate the use of diagnostic ultrasound through recommendations and requirements for personnel qualifications, quality assurance and quality control programs and facility accreditation.\nInformation for Facilities Conducting Ultrasound Imaging\nUltrasound practices should consider site and staff participation in voluntary accreditation and certification programs that address both safety and effectiveness of the device following the principles of As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA), such as those offered by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine and the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers.\nAny health care facility employing ultrasound should conduct regular quality control tests to ensure that equipment is functioning properly.\nInformation for Industry: Ultrasound Manufacturers\nManufacturers of electronic radiation emitting products sold in the United States are responsible for compliance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), Chapter V, Subchapter C - Electronic Product Radiation Control.\nManufacturers of ultrasound imaging products are responsible for compliance with all applicable requirements of Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (Subchapter J, Radiological Health) Parts 1000 through 1005:\n1000 - General\n1002 - Records and Reports\n1003 - Notification of defects or failure to comply\n1004 - Repurchase, repairs, or replacement of electronic products\n1005 - Importation of electronic products\nThere are no federal radiation safety performance standards for diagnostic ultrasound.\nBecause they are medical devices, ultrasound imaging equipment must also comply with the medical device regulations.

        "content": "FDA sometimes receives questions about the safe use of cosmetics during pregnancy.  If you are pregnant and have concerns about cosmetic products or ingredients, contact your health care provider. While FDA can’t give medical advice, we can provide some general safety information.\nOn This Page: \n\nWhat the Law Says About Cosmetic Safety\nHow FDA Monitors Cosmetic Safety\nSafety Information in Cosmetic Labeling\nSome “Personal Care Products” That Are Not Cosmetics\nMore Resources\n\n\nWhat the Law Says About Cosmetic Safety\nIt’s important to know that the law does not require cosmetic products or ingredients to have FDA approval before they go on the market. However, cosmetics must be safe when consumers use them according to product labeling, or as the products are customarily used.\nCompanies and individuals who manufacture or market cosmetics are legally responsible for making sure their products are safe. FDA can take action against an unsafe cosmetic that doesn’t comply with the law, but first we need reliable information showing that it is unsafe when people use it as intended.\nThe law treats color additives differently. Color additives must be approved by FDA before they are used in cosmetics or other FDA-regulated products. Some must even be from batches certified in FDA’s own labs.\nThe law also makes a special exception for coal tar hair dyes, which include most permanent, semi-permanent, and temporary hair dyes on the market. FDA cannot take action against a coal-tar hair dye if it has this statement on the label—\n”Caution  - This product contains ingredients which may cause skin irritation on certain individuals and a preliminary test according to accompanying directions should first be made. This product must not be used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows; to do so may cause blindness.”\n—along with instructions for doing a skin test.\nHow FDA Monitors Cosmetic Safety\nFDA monitors the safety of cosmetics in several ways. For example, FDA periodically buys cosmetics and analyzes them, especially if we are aware of a potential problem. FDA scientists keep up with the latest research and FDA conducts its own research as well.  We also evaluate reports of problems that are sent to us by consumers who have had bad reactions, to watch for trends that will tell us if a particular product may require action on FDA’s part.\nWhen we look into the safety of a cosmetic product or ingredient on the market, we consider factors such as how it is used and who is likely to use it. This includes whether there are likely to be safety concerns when women use the product during pregnancy. When we identify a safety problem, we let the public know and take action against the product. To learn more, see “How FDA Evaluates Regulated Products: Cosmetics.”\nSafety Information in Cosmetic Labeling\nCosmetics must be labeled properly. For example, they must have any directions for use and any warnings needed to make sure consumers use the product safely.\nAlso, cosmetics marketed on a retail basis to consumers, such as in stores or person to person, must have a list of ingredients on the label. For cosmetics sold by mail order, including online, this list must be on the label, in a catalog, on a website, enclosed with the shipment, or sent separately when the consumer asks for it. This list lets consumers know if a product contains ingredients they want to avoid.\nSome “Personal Care Products” That Are Not Cosmetics\nNot all “personal care products,” including those you might use during and after pregnancy, are cosmetics. For example, a product that’s intended to affect the structure or function of your body, or to treat or prevent disease, is regulated as a drug, or sometimes both a cosmetic and a drug. This is true even if it affects how you look. Stretch mark treatments, creams for treating irritated or cracked nipples, sunscreens, antiperspirants, and treatments for dandruff and acne are some common examples. \nGenerally, non-prescription drugs must conform to special regulations, called \"monographs,\" for their product category or be approved by FDA before they go on the market.\nTo learn more, see “Cosmetics Q&A: Personal Care Products.”\nMore Resources\n\nPregnancy: A Time for Special Caution\nConsumer Information: Pregnancy\n\nProduct and Ingredient Safety\n\nColor Additives and Cosmetics\nEye Cosmetic Safety\nHair Products (Hair Dyes, Straighteners, Brazilian Blowout keratin hair smoothing treatment)\n“Hypoallergenic” Cosmetics\nMakeup\nNail Care Products\nParabens\nPhthalates\nProhibited and Restricted Ingredients\nPotential Contaminants\nTattoos and Permanent Makeup (Reactions, removal, contaminated inks)\nView More Product and Ingredient Safety Information\n\nMore Cosmetic Safety and Regulatory Resources\n\nConsumer Updates (Articles on trending health concerns)\nCosmetics Q&A: Answers to frequently asked questions\nCosmetics Fact Sheet (from FDA’s Office of Women’s Health)\nHow FDA Evaluates Regulated Products: Cosmetics\nIs It a Cosmetic, a Drug, or Both?

Sin embargo, también puede que la haga sentir intranquila si no está segura de cómo sus medicamentos afectarán a su bebé. No todas las medicinas son seguras cuando está embarazada. Incluso la medicina para el dolor de cabeza o dolor en general pueden no ser seguras durante ciertos períodos de su embarazo.\nAquí hay 4 consejos para ayudarla a informarse mejor sobre cómo las medicinas de venta con o sin receta médica podrían afectarla a usted y a su bebé.\n1. Pregunte\n\nSiempre hable con su doctor, enfermera o farmacéutico antes de comenzar a tomar cualquier medicamento, hierba o vitamina. No deje de tomar sus medicinas a menos que su proveedor de servicios de salud le diga que puede hacerlo.\nHaga estas preguntas:\n\n¿Necesitaré cambiar mi medicina si quedo embarazada?\nAntes de quedar embarazada, prepara un plan junto con tu médico que te ayude a usar los medicamentos sin correr riesgos.\n¿Cómo podría afectar esta medicina a mi bebé? Pregunte sobre los beneficios y los riesgos para usted y para su bebé.\n¿Qué medicinas y hierbas debo evitar? Algunos medicamentos pueden perjudicar a su bebé durante las diferentes etapas de su embarazo. En tales instancias, es posible que su médico le recete otra cosa.\n¿Tendré que aumentar o disminuir la dosis de mi medicina? Si estás embarazada tu corazón y tus riñones trabajan más. Por lo tanto, los medicamentos pasan por tu cuerpo más rápido que de costumbre.\n¿Qué clase de vitaminas debo tomar? Pregunte por las vitaminas especiales para las mujeres encinta. No tome vitaminas ordinarias, pues su contenido de las que usted necesita puede ser demasiado alto o demasiado bajo. También pregunte cuánto ácido fólico debe tomar antes de quedar embarazada y a lo largo de la primera parte de su embarazo. El ácido fólico ayuda a prevenir defectos congénitos del cerebro o la columna vertebral del bebé.\n¿Podré seguir tomando esta medicina cuando empiece a amamantar? Algunos fármacos pueden pasar a la leche materna y afectar a su bebé.\n\n\n2. Lea la etiqueta\n\nLea la etiqueta de información farmacológica y demás información que reciba junto con su medicamento para conocer los posibles riesgos que corren las mujeres embarazadas o lactantes. Las etiquetas le indican lo que se sabe acerca de cómo los medicamentos podrían afectar a las mujeres embarazadas. Su prestador de servicios de salud puede ayudarle a decidir si debe o no tomar el medicamento.\nLas etiquetas de los medicamentos de venta con receta están cambiando. Las nuevas etiquetas reemplazarán a las viejas categorías A, B, C, D y X con más información útil sobre los riesgos de una medicina. Las etiquetas también incluirán más información en cuanto a si el fármaco pasa o no a la leche materna y cómo podría afectar al bebé.\n¿Embarazada? ¿Amamantando? Ya viene en camino una mejor información farmacológica\n\n3. Tenga cuidado en Internet\n\nPregunte a su médico, enfermera o farmacéutico acerca de la información que obtenga en línea. Algunos sitios de Internet dicen que es seguro tomar ciertos medicamentos durante el embarazo pero usted debe preguntarle a su proveedor de servicios de salud primero. El cuerpo de cada mujer es diferente. Puede ser que no sea seguro para usted.\n\nNo se fíe de la seguridad de un producto sólo porque diga ser \"natural\".\nVerifique con su proveedor de servicios de salud antes de usar un producto del que se haya enterado en una portal o grupo de chat.\n\nRecursos en línea\n\nMotherToBaby \ntext4baby \nMarch of Dimes \n\n\n4. Informe los problemas\n\nPrimero, informe a su proveedor de servicios de salud acerca de cualquier problema que tenga con su medicina. También, informe a la FDA acerca de cualquier problema grave que haya tenido luego de tomar un medicamento.\n\nLlame al 1-800-FDA-1088 para recibir un formulario para informar por correo.\nInforme los problemas en línea: www.fda.gov/MedWatch\n\nReporte a la FDA cualquier problema grave que haya tenido luego de tomar un medicamento.\nInscríbase en un registro de exposición a medicamentos durante el embarazo.\n\nLos registros de exposición a medicamentos durante el embarazo son estudios de investigación que recaban la información de mujeres que reciben una vacuna o toman medicinas por prescripción médica durante el embarazo. Estos registros ayudan a las mujeres y a sus médicos a aprender cómo los medicamentos pueden usarse de una manera segura durante el embarazo.\n\nAyude a otras mujeres embarazadas, compartiendo las experiencias que ha tenido con las medicinas.\nNo se le pedirá tomar ningún medicamento nuevo.\nUsted proporcionará información sobre su salud y la de su bebé.\n\nLa FDA no maneja ningún registro de exposición a medicamentos durante el embarazo, pero sí mantiene una lista de éstos. Vea si existe un registro para su medicamento en www.fda.gov/pregnancyregistries\nKit de herramientas sobre el embarazo para redes sociales\nLa Oficina de Salud de la Mujer de la FDA ofrece recursos para ayudar a las mujeres y a los proveedores de atención médica a informarse sobre los medicamentos y otros productos utilizados durante el embarazo. ¿Quiere ayudar a informar a mujeres embarazadas sobre temas como el uso seguro de los medicamentos? Use el kit de herramientas sobre el embarazo para redes sociales y comparta la información con las mujeres embarazadas de su red.

The PLLR removes pregnancy letter categories – A, B, C, D and X. The PLLR also requires the label to be updated when information becomes outdated.\nBelow is a comparison of the current prescription drug labeling with the new PLLR labeling requirements.\n \n\nThe Pregnancy subsection (8.1) includes information for a pregnancy exposure registry for the drug when one is available. Pregnancy exposure registries collect and maintain data on the effects of approved drugs that are prescribed to and used by pregnant women.

Information in the Pregnancy sub-section includes a Risk Summary, Clinical considerations, and Data. Information formerly found in the “Labor and delivery” subsection is now included in the “Pregnancy” subsection.\nThe Nursing mothers subsection was renamed, the Lactation subsection (8.2), and provides information about using the drug while breastfeeding, such as the amount of drug in breast milk and potential effects on the breastfed infant.\nThe Females and Males of Reproductive Potential subsection (8.3), new to the labeling, includes information, when necessary, about the need for pregnancy testing, contraception recommendations, and information about infertility as it relates to the drug.\nThe labeling changes go into effect on June 30, 2015. Prescription drugs and biologic products submitted after June 30, 2015, will use the new format immediately, while labeling for prescription drugs approved on or after June 30, 2001, will be phased in gradually.\nLabeling for over-the-counter (OTC) medicines will not change; OTC drug products are not affected by the final rule.\nConcurrently with publishing the PLLR, FDA also issued draft guidance for industry to assist drug manufacturers in complying with the new labeling content and format requirements.\nAdditional Pregnancy and Lactation Information\n\nPregnant?

        "topic": "Types of breast pumps",
        "content": "All breast pumps consist of a few basic parts:\na. Breast Shield: a cone-shaped cup that fits over the nipple and the circular area surrounding the nipple (the areola).\nb. Pump: creates the gentle vacuum that expresses milk. The pump may be attached to the breast-shield or have plastic tubing to connect the pump to the breast-shield.\nc. Milk Container: a detachable container that fits below the breast-shield and collects milk as it is pumped. The container is typically a reusable bottle or disposable bag that can be used to store the milk or be attached to a nipple and used for feeding a baby.\nTypes of Breast Pumps\n\nThere are three basic types of breast pumps:\n\nManual pumps\nBattery-powered pumps\nElectric pumps\n\nA breast pump is typically held in place by hand or by a nursing bra, a breast pumping bra or a band.\nBreast pumps extract milk from the breasts by creating a seal around the nipple and applying and releasing suction to the nipple, which expresses milk from the breast. Each suction and release combination is called a cycle.\nManual Pumps\nOnce the breast-shield is placed over the nipple and areola, a handle or lever is squeezed to create suction and express milk from the breast. The breast milk is then collected in an attached container.\nSome manual pumps have a small tube which is pumped in and out of a larger tube to create a vacuum that expresses milk and collects it in an attached container.\nAnother type of manual pump, called a bicycle horn pump, consists of a hollow rubber ball attached to a breast-shield. Some experts discourage the use of bicycle horn pumps because they may be difficult to clean and dry.\nBattery-Powered and Electric Pumps\nA powered breast pump uses batteries or a cord plugged into an electrical outlet to power a small motorized pump that creates suction to extract milk from the breasts. It may have one or more long tubes connecting the breast-shield to the electric pump. The pump has a control panel with a dial or switch to control the degree of suction.\nSome powered breast pumps can be adjusted to create different patterns of suction. Some manufacturers claim the adjustable suction allows the user to find a setting that closely mimics her nursing baby, including features with phases such as let-down. Let-down is the natural reflex which starts the release of milk when the nipple area is stimulated, such as by breastfeeding or breast pumping.\nBecause these breast pumps rely on a power source, women who use powered breast pumps should be prepared for emergency situations when electricity or extra batteries may not be available. If breastfeeding is not an option, having extra supplies for pumping and a back-up method, such as a manual breast pump, may help a woman maintain her breast pumping schedule during an emergency.\nPumping Types\nThere are two different pumping types: single and double.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPumping Type\nHow it Works\nTypes of Breast Pumps\n\n\n\n\nSingle\nExtracts milk from one breast at a time.\nMost manual breast pumps are single pumps.\n\t\t\tMost battery-powered pumps are single pumps.\n\n\nDouble\nCan be used to extract milk from both breasts at the same time.\n\t\t\tA separate breast-shield can be attached to each breast to stimulate both nipples at the same time.\nSome electric pumps are double pumps."

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nIf you’re giving your baby breast milk, you probably know there can be times when a breast pump can come in handy.\nBreast pumps are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They can be used to maintain or increase a woman’s milk supply, relieve engorged breasts and plugged milk ducts, or pull out flat or inverted nipples so a nursing baby can latch on more easily.\nAnd there are important safety considerations if you use one.\nWhat kinds of breast pumps are available?\n\n\n\nA. Breast shield: Cone-shaped cup that fits over the nipple and surrounding area.\nB. Milk container: Detachable container that fits below the breast shield and collects milk as it is pumped.\nC. Pump: Creates the vacuum that expresses milk. The pump may be attached to the breast-shield or have plastic tubing to connect the pump to the breast shield.\n\nBreast pumps include a breast shield that fits over the nipple, a pump that creates a vacuum to express (or pump) milk, and a detachable container for collecting milk.\nPumps can be manual or powered. Powered pumps can use batteries or a cord that plugs into an electrical outlet. Some pumps even have an adapter for use in the car. (Obviously not while you’re driving, however!)\nDouble pumps extract milk from both breasts at the same time, while single pumps extract milk from one breast. (Find food safety tips for babies, including breast milk storage tips, on the FDA’s website.)\nIs it safe to rent or share a breast pump?\nRenting or sharing these devices can be dangerous if pumps are not designed for multiple users.\nConsumers should be aware of the hazards of renting or sharing a breast pump that is not designed for multiple users—even with family and friends. Contaminated breast pumps could cause you and your baby to develop an infection.\n“Even if a used device looks really clean, potentially infectious particles may survive in the breast pump and/or its accessories for a surprisingly long time,” says Kelly Colden, M.D., M.P.H., an FDA obstetrician-gynecologist on the Center for Devices and Radiological Health Obstetrical and Reproductive Health Devices Team.\nKey points:\n\nManual breast pumps are designed for one user only (single use) and should never be rented or shared for safety reasons.\nPowered breast pumps that are designed for single users should never be rented or shared.\nSharing a breast pump may violate the manufacturer’s warranty, which means you may not be able to get help from the manufacturer if you have a problem with the pump.\nThe FDA does not recognize the term “hospital grade,” so this term doesn’t mean a pump is safe.\n\nThe bottom line for sharing breast pumps designed for single users? Don’t do it.\nAnd if you rent or share from an authorized provider (such as a hospital, lactation consultant, or specialty medical supply store), do so only if the pump is designed for multiple users. And do so only if you have your own accessories kit to avoid contamination. The accessories kit typically includes the milk container, breast-shield, and tubing.\nMultiple-user pumps are designed so that the breast milk can never touch the working parts of the pump that are shared. The only part of a multiple-user breast pump that you can safely share is the pump itself.\nWhat kind of breast pump should you buy?\nIf you purchase a pump, consider your needs. For instance, if you’ll use the pump only at home, one that plugs into the wall may be fine. But if you’ll pump at work or otherwise away from home, you may want to consider a device that’s easy to carry and battery-powered.\nKey points:\n\nYou should never buy a previously used or “pre-owned” pump designed for single users. That’s because these pumps sold secondhand also can expose you and your baby to contamination.\nBuying a used pump may violate the manufacturer’s warranty.\n\nIf you’re not sure which pump or accessories to get, talk to a health care professional who has expertise in breastfeeding.\nHow should you clean a breast pump?\nContamination can happen even to your personal pump if it is not cleaned properly. Correct use and cleaning helps protect you and your baby.\nThe FDA recommends cleaning and disinfection between uses. You should read the manufacturer’s instructions for specific information on how to keep your pump clean.\nIn general, steps for cleaning include:\n\nRinsing each piece that comes into contact with breast milk in cool water as soon as possible after pumping;\nWashing each piece separately using liquid dishwashing soap and plenty of warm water;\nRinsing each piece thoroughly with hot water for 10 to 15 seconds; and\nPlacing the pieces on a clean paper towel or in a clean drying rack and allowing them to air dry.\n\nWiping the pump body with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol at 70 to 90 percent concentration—or boiling the breast pump parts in water—generally is also acceptable. If the tubing looks moldy or cloudy, stop use and replace the tubing immediately.\nIf you’re renting or buying a multiple-user device, ask the person providing the pump to make sure all components (including internal tubing), have been cleaned and disinfected according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nHow should breast milk be stored after expressing?\nThere are general guidelines for storing the milk you express. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and HHS Office of Women's Health have information on how to safely store and prepare expressed breast milk.\nHow can you report problems with breast pumps?\nIf a breast pump is not working as it should—for instance, if there are electrical problems or issues with suction—you can contact the manufacturer for recommendations on what to do with your device.\nIf you’re injured while using a breast pump or have pain, contact your health care provider. The FDA also encourages you to report injuries or problems with regulated devices to the agency. You can file a voluntary report by phone at 1-800-FDA-1088 or online at MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program."

        "content": "This page provides general information about cleaning a breast pump. For specific information about cleaning your breast pump, check the pump’s instruction manual for the manufacturer-recommended method of cleaning.\nCleaning Breast Pump Parts\nAll breast pump parts that come in contact with breast milk, such as bottles, valves and breast shields, should be cleaned after each use. It is not possible to completely sterilize breast pump parts at home, even if you boil them. However, sterilization is not necessary to keep these parts safe and sanitary. You can do that by thoroughly washing away germs and bacteria with liquid dishwashing soap and warm water.\nSome breast pumps parts can be put in the top rack of a dishwasher. Consult your instruction manual to make sure pieces are dishwasher safe before you put them in the dishwasher.\nIt is not necessary to clean breast pump tubing unless it comes in contact with breast milk. If you wash your tubing, make sure you hang it to air dry before attaching it to your breast pump. If small water drops (condensation) appear in the tubing after you have pumped, turn the pump on for a few minutes until the tubing is dry.\nMicrowave sterilizers are available for breast pump parts, but these sterilizers do not meet the FDA definition of sterilization. However, they will adequately reprocess the parts, which is sufficient for safe use by a single user.\nCleaning the Electrical Unit for a Powered Breast Pump\nElectrical units, which hold the motor and batteries, should be wiped down with a clean paper towel or soft cloth after each use.\nThe electrical unit should never be put into water or other liquids for cleaning. It should also never be cleaned using a microwave sterilizer.\nSome breast pump manufacturers make wipes just for cleaning breast pumps, which can make cleaning more convenient when you are away from home. Even if these wipes are used, breast pump parts that come into contact with breast milk should still be cleaned using liquid dishwashing soap and warm water before pumping.\nBasic Cleaning Method\n\nConsult the instruction manual to determine which parts should be washed and the best method for removing parts that must be cleaned.\nRinse each piece that comes into contact with breast milk in cool water as soon as possible after pumping.\nWash each piece separately using liquid dishwashing soap and plenty of warm water.\nRinse each piece thoroughly with hot water for 10-15 seconds.\nPlace the pieces neatly on a clean paper towel or in a clean drying rack and allow them to air dry.\nAvoid using cloth towels to dry your pump parts because they can carry germs and bacteria that are harmful to your breast milk and your baby.\nOnce the pump parts are dry, assemble the pump before you store it or use it.\nTry not to touch the inside of any parts that will come in contact with your breast milk."

        "topic": "Buying and renting a breast pump",
        "content": "Breast pumps are often sold at hospitals, baby supply stores and the baby supply sections of toy stores. They are also available at many online retailers. If you buy a breast pump online, make sure you are buying from a reputable source. Also check the store’s return policy and customer support statement before you place an order.\nBefore you buy a pump, check the manufacturer’s website or review the instructions on the box. Make sure you can easily assemble and use the breast pump. Keep in mind that if you buy a pump and decide you do not like it, most stores will not allow you to return it for health reasons.\nA certified lactation consultant may be able to help you decide which breast pump may be right for you. The International Lactation Consultant Association’s website offers a directory on their website to help find a lactation consultant near you at International Lactation Association website.\nRenting a Breast Pump\nAn alternative to buying a pump is to rent one. Many hospitals, lactation consultants, and specialty medical supply stores rent breast pumps that are safe for multiple users (sometimes referred to as hospital-grade pumps). These pumps are designed to decrease the risk of contamination and each renter is required to buy a new accessories kit that includes breast-shields and tubing.\nPlease note that the term “hospital-grade pump” is not recognized by the FDA and there is no consistent definition for this term, so individual companies could mean different things when they label their breast pumps as hospital-grade.\nIf you are considering renting a pump, ask for references from a trusted health professional such as your doctor, your baby’s doctor or a certified lactation consultant. Also check with your local Better Business Bureau and the device manufacturer before renting a pump to ensure that the rental company is reputable and the breast pump you will be renting is safe for multiple users.\nUsed Breast Pumps\nOnly breast pumps that are designed for multiple users should be used by more than one person. With the exception of multiple user pumps, the FDA considers breast pumps to be single-user devices. That means that a breast pump should only be used by one woman because there is no way to guarantee the pump can be cleaned and disinfected between uses by different women.\nBreast pumps that are reused by different mothers can carry infectious particles, which can make you or your baby sick.\nBuying a used breast pump or sharing a breast pump may be a violation of the manufacturer’s warranty and you may not be able to get help from the manufacturer if you have a problem with the pump.\nPrograms to Help Pay for a Breast Pump\nDuring the prenatal care period, contact your private health insurance company to determine what assistance is provided for breastfeeding and breast pumping equipment, including the assistance of a certified lactation consultant or breastfeeding clinic for supportive care.\nSome state health departments offer programs to help women purchase or rent a breast pump. For more information on the programs offered by your state, contact your state health department.\nSome women may also be eligible to receive assistance with breastfeeding supplies, such as a breast pump, through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. For more information, contact your state’s WIC representative."

Information on breastfeeding can be found at:HHS BreastfeedingCDC BreastfeedingUSPSTF 2014 Guide to Clinical Preventive Services on Breastfeeding CounselingAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines In some situations, instead of breastfeeding parents may look for alternative sources of human breast milk to feed their babies.Consult a healthcare provider firstThe choice to feed a baby human milk from a source other than the baby’s mother should be made in consultation with the baby’s healthcare provider, because the nutritional needs of each baby depend on many factors including the baby’s age and health.Consider the possible safety risksIf you are considering feeding a baby with human milk from a source other than the baby’s mother, you should know that there are possible health and safety risks for the baby. Risks for the baby include exposure to infectious diseases, including HIV, to chemical contaminants, such as some illegal drugs, and to a limited number of prescription drugs that might be in the human milk, if the donor has not been adequately screened. In addition, if human milk is not handled and stored properly, it could, like any type of milk, become contaminated and unsafe to drink.FDA recommends against feeding your baby breast milk acquired directly from individuals or through the InternetWhen human milk is obtained directly from individuals or through the Internet, the donor is unlikely to have been adequately screened for infectious disease or contamination risk. In addition, it is not likely that the human milk has been collected, processed, tested or stored in a way that reduces possible safety risks to the baby.FDA recommends that if, after consultation with a healthcare provider, you decide to feed a baby with human milk from a source other than the baby’s mother, you should only use milk from a source that has screened its milk donors and taken other precautions to ensure the safety of its milk.There are human milk banks that take voluntary steps to screen milk donors, and safely collect, process, handle, test, and store the milk. In a few states, there are required safety standards for such milk banks. FDA has not been involved in establishing these voluntary guidelines or state standards.You can contact your state’s department of health to find out if it has information on human milk banks in your area. Another source of information is the Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA), a voluntary professional association for human milk banks (http://www.hmbana.org/ ). HMBANA issues voluntary safety guidelines for member banks on screening donors, and collecting, processing, handling, testing and storing milk."

        "topic": "Using codeine and tramadol products in breastfeeding women",
        "content": "1. What is codeine and how is it used?\nCodeine is a type of pain medicine called an opioid. Codeine is used to treat mild to moderate pain and also to reduce coughing where treatment with an opioid is appropriate and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. It is usually combined with other medicines, such as acetaminophen, in prescription pain medicines and over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription cough and cold medicines.\n\nWhen codeine enters the body, it is changed (metabolized) in the liver to morphine, the active form. Morphine relieves pain and cough and is also responsible for side effects that some people may experience.\n\n \n2. What is tramadol and how is it used?\nTramadol is a prescription opioid medication approved for use in adults to treat pain that is severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate.\n\n\nSimilar to codeine, when tramadol enters the body, it is changed in the liver to its active form, O-desmethyltramadol (known as M1). Both tramadol and M1 relieve pain and are responsible for side effects that some people may experience, but M1 has stronger opioid effects than the tramadol.\n\n\n \n3. What is an “ultra-rapid metabolizer”?\nCodeine and tramadol are metabolized in the liver to their active forms by an enzyme called cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6). Some people have a variation of this enzyme that changes codeine to morphine and tramadol to M1 faster and to a greater extent than in other people. These individuals are called CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers.\n\nThe number of CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers varies among different population groups (see Table 1).\nFor people who are ultra-rapid metabolizers, the specific likelihood of having an adverse event when taking codeine or tramadol is not known.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Approximate number of CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers in different populations\n\n\nPopulation\nUltra-rapid metabolizers (per 100 people)\n\n\n\n\nWhites (European, North American)\n1-10\n\n\nBlacks (African Americans)\n3-4\n\n\nEast Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)\n1-2\n\n\nOceanian, Northern African, Middle Eastern, Ashkenazi Jews, Puerto Rican\nMay be >10\n\n\n\n\nReference: Gaedigk et el, Genet Med, 2017; PMID: 27388693\n \n\n4. What new information is FDA announcing about codeine and tramadol with respect to breastfeeding mothers?\nIn our review of the medical literature for data regarding codeine use during breastfeeding, we found numerous cases of excess sleepiness and serious breathing problems, including one death, in infants of breastfeeding mothers who were taking codeine. A review of the available medical literature for data regarding tramadol use during breastfeeding did not reveal any cases of adverse events. However, tramadol and its metabolite M1 are also present in breast milk, and tramadol has the same risk as codeine with regard to ultra-rapid metabolism and the potential for life-threatening respiratory depression in an infant breastfeeding from a mother who is an ultra-rapid metabolizer.\n\nIn breastfeeding mothers, the ultra-rapid conversion of codeine to morphine and tramadol to M1 can result in high and unsafe levels of morphine and M1 in blood and breast milk.\n\n \n5. What is FDA doing in response to this information related to women who are breastfeeding?\nThe FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication regarding the strengthened warning to mothers (among other warnings) that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with codeine or tramadol due to the risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants such as excess sleepiness, difficulty breastfeeding, and serious breathing problems that may result in death.\n\nThe FDA wants breastfeeding mothers or caregivers to watch closely for signs of problems in infants when the mothers are taking any opioid pain medicine, and especially when they are using codeine or tramadol for pain. Because most mothers will not know if they are ultra-rapid metabolizers, they will not know that using codeine or tramadol may place their babies at greater risk for an overdose.\nThe FDA urges healthcare providers and breastfeeding mothers to report side effects that occur while using codeine or tramadol to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online, by regular mail or by fax.\n\n \n6. What should health care professionals do in response to this new information?\nHealthcare professionals should be aware that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with codeine or tramadol due to the risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants such as excess sleepiness, difficulty breastfeeding, and serious breathing problems, which may result in death. We also encourage health care professionals to read the Drug Safety Communication regarding all new warnings the FDA is communicating about these products.\n \n7. What are the symptoms of opioid overdose in infants?\n\nIncreased sleepiness (breastfed babies usually eat every 2 to 3 hours and should not sleep more than 4 hours at a time)\nDifficulty breastfeeding\nBreathing difficulties\nLimpness in the baby\n\n\n\n\n\t  If a breastfed baby shows these symptoms, the baby’s doctor must be called right away. An overdose of opioid pain medicine in a baby can cause death. If the doctor cannot be reached right away, the baby should be taken to an emergency room or help should be sought by calling 911 (or local emergency services).\n\t\n\n\n \n8. What are the symptoms of opioid overdose in a breastfeeding mother?\nThe signs of opioid overdose in the breastfeeding mother are the same as can occur with any person taking an opioid. These include trouble breathing, shortness of breath, extreme drowsiness, light-headedness when changing positions, or feeling faint. Breastfeeding mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have symptoms of too much opioid, even if they are taking a dose that would not otherwise be expected to cause an overdose. If any of these symptoms occur, the mother, family members, or other close contacts should call her doctor or 911 right away.\n \n9. Should a breastfeeding mother using codeine stop breastfeeding?\nIt is important for health care professionals and breastfeeding women to discuss the use of pain medicines and to consider alternatives to codeine or tramadol. Because most people do not know if they are ultra-rapid metabolizers, and because early signs of opioid overdose in an infant may be difficult to notice, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with codeine or tramadol.\n \n10. What should breastfeeding mothers do about this new information?\n\nA breastfeeding mother should talk to her doctor about pain medicines other than codeine or tramadol.\nA breastfeeding mother should know that some over-the-counter cough/cold combination products contain codeine. Breastfeeding mothers should check the label of all over-the-counter drugs they take to see if codeine is an ingredient. Mothers should also check the label of all over-the-counter medicines for warnings about use while they are breastfeeding and should talk to their doctor before using all over-the-counter medicines.\n\n \n11. Are there any tests that can be used to help identify mothers who are CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers?\nThere is an FDA-cleared test to determine whether a patient is a CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer. These tests are not routinely done but may help healthcare professionals make individualized treatment decisions for a patient.\n \n12. Should a breastfeeding mother of a newborn ask her doctor to be tested to determine if she is an ultra-rapid metabolizer of codeine or tramadol?\nThe mother should discuss her concerns with her doctor, and her doctor may select another pain medication that is not subject to the risks associated with CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolism.\n \n13.

Ensuring that the youngest and most vulnerable individuals have access to safe and nutritionally adequate formula products is a top priority for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The agency regulates the production of infant formulas to help ensure that these products are safe and support healthy growth in infants who consume them. The agency also works with multiple partners in public health to ensure that parents and caregivers have the latest information regarding safe preparation of infant formula and to answer questions regarding the safety and nutritional quality of formula. In addition, the FDA is working on multiple fronts to support the availability and resiliency of the infant formula market.\nOn this page:\n\nHow does the FDA oversee the safety and nutritional quality of infant formula?\nAdvice for Parents and Other Caregivers\nSafe Preparation and Feeding of Formulas\nInformation for Infant Formula Manufacturers \nLatest News\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n \n\nHow does the FDA oversee the safety and nutritional quality of infant formula? \nInfant formula is a food that may be the sole source of nutrition for infants (i.e., children up to 12 months of age) as an alternative to human milk. The FDA regulatory requirements address, among other issues, the safety, nutritional adequacy, packaging, and labeling of these products. The FDA does not approve infant formulas; however, infant formula manufacturers must notify the agency before marketing a new formula. The FDA’s highly trained staff review these notifications to make sure new formulas meet federal nutrition, labeling, and other requirements. If a product does not meet applicable requirements, the formula may be deemed adulterated, misbranded, or both, and the FDA has the authority to take enforcement action. For example, the FDA can require a mandatory recall of product if the agency determines that an adulterated or misbranded infant formula presents a risk to human health.\nAmong the requirements for infant formulas, the FDA specifies 30 nutrients that must be included in infant formulas. There are minimum amounts for all 30 nutrients and maximum amounts for 10 nutrients. In addition, any ingredient used in infant formula must be safe and suitable for such use. Additionally, sanitary controls are required by law to prevent contamination and other safety problems from occurring. For example, manufacturers must establish a system of controls designed to ensure that infant formula does not become adulterated due to the presence of microorganisms in the formula or in the processing environment. Further, the FDA regulations set forth certain testing requirements of finished product for Salmonella and Cronobacter. FDA regulations also require that the water the companies use to manufacture formulas meets safety standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe FDA has specific requirements for labeling infant formulas. Information that is most helpful for caregivers of infants includes directions for preparation and use, and a pictogram showing the major steps for preparing infant formula, a “use by” date.\nThe FDA inspects facilities that manufacture infant formulas annually and carefully trains its investigators to ensure that every infant formula inspection is robust, thorough, and focused on the most critical aspects of the infant formula manufacturing process.\nAll Infant formula products sold in the U.S., whether produced domestically or imported, must meet all U.S. requirements, including those for safety and nutritional adequacy. Caregivers should use caution when ordering imported products online or from third party distributors because some of these products have not undergone FDA's rigorous premarket review process and do not meet U.S. requirements for safety or nutritional adequacy.\n\n \n\nAdvice for Parents and Other Caregivers \n\nWhile breastfeeding is strongly encouraged by the American Academy of Pediatrics, most infants in the U.S. rely on infant formula for some or all of their nutrition. The agency is working with manufacturers, who are now required to have risk redundancy plans, to ensure a stable and consistent supply of infant formula in the U.S., but we recognize that at times it may be difficult to find the formula you need. The Department of Health and Human Services has made resources available explaining what to do if you can’t find your formula.\n\nProducts on the Market\nCheck with your infant’s health care provider to determine which infant formula to choose.\nRoutine formulas are formulas intended for healthy, full-term infants. These formulas may contain cow’s milk, goat’s milk, or soy. Some formulas for healthy, full-term infants are specifically manufactured to address specific but common digestive needs. For example:\n\nPartially hydrolyzed infant formula contains cow’s milk proteins that have already been partially hydrolyzed, or broken down, and may be easier to digest.\nSpit-up formulas are thickened with the aim of reducing acid reflux.\nLactose-free formula contains no lactose (a sugar found in milk) for infants that have difficulty digesting it.\n\nSpecialty formulas are intended for use by an infant who has an inborn error of metabolism, low birth weight, or who otherwise has an unusual medical or dietary problem. Some of these formulas are not available in retail settings and may be prescribed by a physician. Examples include:\n\nHypoallergenic formulas with extensively hydrolyzed protein that are effective for the treatment of milk protein allergy. In these formulas, the protein has been broken down so that it can be more easily digested.\nFormulas to treat a specific medical condition such as an inborn error of metabolism. For example, a formula for individuals with Phenylketonuria (PKU) does not contain the amino acid phenylalanine.\nInfant formulas for premature infants, which may include more nutrients and calories to meet their increased nutritional needs.\nAmino-acid-based formulas, which contain amino acids as their protein source. These formulas can be used for infants with severe milk allergies, short-gut syndrome, or other medical conditions.\n\nDue to their composition and intended use to address specific conditions, specialty formulas may be exempt from certain nutrition labeling and nutrient specifications.\nInfant formulas come in three forms:\n\nPowder — Must be mixed with water before feeding.\nLiquid concentrate — Must be mixed with an equal amount of water before feeding.\nReady-to-feed — Requires no mixing.\n\nThe infant formulas currently available in the U.S. must be labeled as either “Infant Formula with Iron” or “Additional Iron May Be Necessary.” The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that formula-fed infants receive an “Infant Formula with Iron” as a way of preventing iron-deficiency anemia.\nFinding Safe Substitutes\n\nOccasionally, you may need use an infant formula that’s different than the one you normally feed your child. The Department of Health and Human Services has a website with dedicated information on finding safe substitutes which was developed with input from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the North American Society For Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition (NASPGHAN).\nIt’s important to note that most babies will do just fine with different brands of formula, including store brands, as long as they're the same type, like cow's milk-based, soy, hypoallergenic (extensively hydrolyzed), or elemental (amino acid-based).\nIf you need help figuring out which formulas you may be able to substitute:\n\nYour pediatrician or other health care provider is always the best resource because they know your baby and their health history.\nYou can also check this list of comparable formulas  developed by an organization of pediatric gastroenterologists called NASPGHAN. Keep in mind that this list focuses on substitutes for formulas that were part of the February 2022 recall, so you might not see your baby's formula listed here. Any substitution should only be done under the recommendation and supervision of your pediatrician or other healthcare provider.\n\nIt may take some time for your baby to get used to the new formula; however, if you notice that your baby begins to vomit, has gas, is crying or can't be calmed down during feedings, is losing weight, has diarrhea, has blood or mucus in their poop, or is straining to poop, they may not be tolerating the new formula. Call your pediatrician or other health care provider if you have questions.\n\n\n \n\nSafe Preparation and Feeding of Formulas\n\nThe safe preparation and feeding of formulas is important to your baby’s health for many reasons. Safe preparation can help prevent infant formula from becoming contaminated with harmful pathogens that can cause foodborne illness, such a Cronobacter or Salmonella. The FDA recommends caregivers prepare infant formula according to instructions on the infant formula label to ensure safety and to uphold the nutritional quality of the formula. These labels should also include information on proper storage and disposal of prepared formula. The FDA also recommends using safe handling techniques. For example, bottles, rings, caps, and nipples need to be cleaned and sanitized. Caregivers should also be mindful of the “Use By” Date, which is the date up to which the manufacturer guarantees the nutrient content and the quality of the formula.\n\nDon’t Feed Infants Homemade Infant Formula\nThe FDA advises parents and caregivers not to make or feed homemade infant formula to infants. Homemade infant formula recipes have not been evaluated by the FDA and may lack nutrients vital to an infant’s growth. The agency has received reports of hospitalized babies who have been fed homemade infant formula and then suffered from hypocalcemia (low calcium). Other potential problems with homemade formulas include contamination. These problems are serious, and the consequences may range from severe nutritional imbalances to foodborne illnesses, both of which can be life-threatening.\nToddler Nutritive Drinks \nToddler nutritive drinks, often marketed as “toddler formulas,” are not necessary to meet the nutritional needs of older babies. Babies younger than age 12 months should be fed infant formulas specifically designed to meet their nutritional needs. They should not be fed toddler drinks or formulas labeled for toddlers. Additionally, toddler nutritive drinks do not undergo premarket review by FDA.\n\n\n\nIdentifying and Reporting a Problem\nIf you have concerns about infant formula, contact your health care provider and FDA at 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332). To report a complaint or adverse event (illness or serious allergic reaction), visit Industry and Consumer Assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation for Infant Formula Manufacturers\nManufacturers of infant formula must comply with applicable Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requirements and those contained in the FDA’s implementing regulations. More information on these requirements can be found on the FDA’s Infant Formula Guidance Documents & Regulatory Information webpage. In addition, the FDA has held a series of webinars (see Webinar Series to Discuss the Infant Formula Transition Plan for Exercise of Enforcement Discretion), for which recordings are now available, that discuss infant formula requirements.\nA manufacturer who intends to market a new infant formula in the U.S. must register with, notify, and submit a written verification of regulatory compliance to the FDA. The FDA encourages infant formula manufacturers to contact IF_manufacturer_questions@fda.hhs.gov with questions about infant formula. New infant formula submissions must generally be sent to the FDA at least 90 days before the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a new infant formula. In response to the infant formula supply disruption that followed the 2022 Abbott voluntary recall, the FDA has also taken multiple steps to improve the resiliency of the infant formula supply, including by providing manufacturers some flexibility through the exercise of enforcement discretion. You can learn more about this work through the agency’s Infant Formula Transition Plan for Exercise of Enforcement Discretion.\nIn 2022, safety concerns with powdered infant formula led to a voluntary recall of specific lots of powdered infant formula products manufactured at an Abbott Nutrition facility in Sturgis, Michigan. Since then, the agency has taken steps to enhance the safety of powdered infant formula through the development of a prevention strategy, enhanced inspection activities, increased engagement with the infant formula industry, and by pursuing regulatory action when appropriate.\nIn March 2023, the FDA issued a letter to the powdered infant formula industry to share current safety information and call on the industry to take prompt action to improve processes and programs for the protection of infants. Among a number of items in the letter, the FDA asked that firms voluntarily notify the FDA any time a product sample is found to be positive for Cronobacter spp. or Salmonella, even if the affected lot(s) have not been distributed. For these notifications of product positives, the FDA recommends that firms report this information through the Office of Regulatory Affairs (“ORA”) Division representative in which the manufacturing facility is located (see this ORA Field Leadership Contacts for further information). Continued communication through this established channel will help ensure that the information is received, acted on, and routed most appropriately in an efficient and timely manner.\nThe FDA also issued three warning letters to infant formula manufacturers in August 2023 to reinforce the importance of instituting and maintaining appropriate corrective actions when pathogens are detected and to comply with FDA’s laws and regulations. In addition, in September 2023 the FDA updated its infant formula compliance program to outline the agency’s approach for inspections, sample collection, sample analysis, and compliance activities related to the oversight of infant formula.\nThe Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to add new requirements for manufacturers of critical foods, such as infant formula, including requirements:\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n\nDate\nRelease\n\n\n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\nReckitt/Mead Johnson Nutrition Voluntarily Recalls Certain Nutramigen Hypoallergenic Powdered Infant Formula Products\n\n\nDecember 13, 2023\nFDA Provides Update on Actions to Strengthen the Safety and Supply Chain Resiliency of Infant Formula\n\n\nOctober 6, 2023\nFDA Issues Updated Compliance Program for Infant Formula\n\n\nSeptember 20, 2023\nFDA Provides Update on the Cronobacter Prevention Strategy\n\n\nSeptember 14, 2023\nFDA Alerts Parents and Caregivers to Concerns Regarding LittleOak Infant Formula\n\n\nMay 19, 2023\nFDA Announces National Academies Study of Supply, Market Competition, and Regulation of Infant Formula in the U.S.\n\n\nApril 26, 2023\nFDA to Host Two Webinars on Infant Formula Food Ingredients and Packaging Requirements\n\n\nMarch 28, 2023\nFDA Outlines Immediate National Strategy to Further Increase the Resiliency of the U.S. Infant Formula Market\n\n\nFebruary 28, 2023\nFDA Provides Update on Proposed Human Foods Program and Office of Regulatory Affairs Restructuring\n\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\nWhat FDA’s Foods Program Achieved in 2022 to Protect Consumers and the Food Supply\n\n\nJanuary 31, 2023\nFDA Proposes Redesign of Human Foods Program to Enhance Coordinated Prevention and Response Activities\n\n\nJanuary 9, 2023\nFDA Issues Letters of Acknowledgement for Infant Formula Transition Plan\n\n\nNovember 17, 2022\nWebinar Series to Discuss the Infant Formula Transition Plan for Exercise of Enforcement Discretion\n\n\nNovember 16, 2022\nFocusing on Prevention to Safeguard Infant Formula\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Safety & Nutrition from FDA\n\nHandling Infant Formula Safely: What You Need to Know\n\n\n\nSafe Feeding of Babies at Higher Risk of Foodborne Illness (Consumer Infographic)\nTips for Safely Preparing Powdered Infant Formula (Consumer Infographic)\nInformation for Health Care Professionals on Safe Handling of Infant Formula\nHelp Prevent Cronobacter Illness: Prepare and Store Powdered Infant Formula Safely (Consumer Infographic)\nQuestions & Answers for Consumers Concerning Infant Formula\nDo's and Don'ts with Infant Formula\nFDA Advises Parents and Caregivers to Not Make or Feed Homemade Infant Formula to Infants\nFood Safety Booklet for Pregnant Women, Their Unborn Babies, and Children Under Five\nFood Safety for Moms-To-Be -

If that isn’t possible, babies will need infant formula. It’s extremely important that germs do not get into infant formula because babies do not have fully developed immune systems which puts them at higher risk for infections.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFDA Oversees Infant Formula Manufacturers\nAll manufacturers of infant formula sold in the United States (U.S.) must register with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Their products must meet the FDA’s nutritional quality and safety standards in order to be sold in the U.S.\nNutritional Requirements\nBased on the nutritional needs of infants, FDA requires minimum amounts for 30 nutrients. FDA sets maximum amounts for 10 of those nutrients that can be harmful to an infant’s growth and development in high amounts, such as Vitamins A and D. Some infant formulas are made and labeled for infants that have certain medical conditions, such as metabolism issues, low birth weight, or an unusual medical or dietary problem. These specialized formulas do not have to meet these requirements.\nTypes of Infant Formula\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPowdered\nMust be mixed with water according to instructions before feeding\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLiquid Concentrate\nMust be mixed with an equal amount of water\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReady-to-Feed\nDo not add water\n\n\n\n\n\nInfant Formula Safety\nInfant formula manufacturers must follow FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices and other regulations to protect against harmful bacteria, viruses, chemicals, and other risks. If a company wants to sell a new formula or make changes to one that they already sell, they must submit the details to FDA.\nThe Dangers of Cronobacter\nCronobacter is a germ found everywhere around us. It can also live in water and in dry foods, such as:\n\nPowdered infant formula\nPowdered milk\nHerbal teas\nStarches, like flour or cornstarch\n\nCronobacter can cause rare but possibly deadly infections in infants, such as sepsis (a condition caused by a serious infection in the body) or meningitis (swelling of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, which can cause death or permanent disabilities).\nPowdered infant formula may get contaminated with germs:\nIn the home: Cronobacter can get into powdered infant formula after the container is opened. Cronobacter can be found in other foods and live on surfaces like kitchen counters or sinks, and in water. Taking care to avoid cross contamination of bottles, nipples, and utensils during preparation is very important.\nIn a processing plant: If the manufacturer unintentionally uses ingredients that contain Cronobacter to make the formula, or if the formula powder touches a surface that has Cronobacter. Infant formula manufacturers must test every batch of infant formula for Cronobacter before release for sale.\nPreparing and Handling Formula Safely\nPreparing Formula - Always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before making formula for your baby.\nCleaning Bottles and Feeding Parts (including breastfeeding pump parts) - Before first use, boil bottles, nipples, caps, rings, and valves for 5 minutes. Afterward, following each use wash them in the dishwasher, if one is available, using hot water and a heated drying cycle (or sanitizing setting). If cleaning the feeding items by hand, wash them in soapy water in a basin used only for formula feeding parts, rinse, and air dry on a paper towel or clean dish towel.\nPowdered Infant Formula Containers and Scoops - Powdered infant formula is unlikely to become contaminated if it stays dry. If you want to clean an unopened powdered infant formula container, use a disinfectant wipe or paper towel sprayed with disinfectant to clean the outside of the container and lid before it is opened for the first time. Don’t submerge the container or put it under running water. Don’t open the container until all surfaces are completely dry. Never clean the inside of the container. If the scoop falls into a sink, on a kitchen counter, or the floor, or is soiled some other way, clean it as you would the baby’s bottle. Let it air dry completely before using it.\nWater - Always use water from a safe source to mix your infant formula. If you are not sure your tap water, whether from a public drinking water supply or private well, is safe to use for preparing infant formula, contact your local health department.\nBottled Water - Bottled water isn’t sterile (free of germs) unless the label says it is. If it is labeled as sterile and is specifically marketed for infants, it must meet FDA requirements for sterility in marketed products. If you use ordinary bottled water to make formula, handle it the same way as safe tap water.\nWater Emergencies - If your water supply is cut off by a watermain break or polluted by a hurricane or flood, use bottled water to make formula instead of tap water. If you must use tap water that may be polluted, boil it for one minute (3 minutes at elevations above 6500 feet). to disinfect it and then let it cool in the pot for five minutes to room temperature before adding it to the bottle.\nMixing - Follow the instructions on the product’s label. Use the exact amount of water that the label says. Formula with too little water can cause dehydration (harmful loss of body fluid). Formula with too much water will not provide enough nutrition and, if fed to your baby for a long time, may result in slower growth. After adding the water, add the exact amount of formula called for on the label and shake to mix.\nStoring - Use prepared infant formula within 2 hours. If it is not used immediately, store the bottle in the refrigerator and use it within 24 hours.\nFormula Warming - Formula does not need to be warmed. If you prefer it warm, the best way is to place the bottle in a pot of water and heat it on the stove until warm (body temperature). Never use microwave ovens for heating infant formulas because microwaving can allow the bottle to remain cool while hot spots develop in the formula that can burn the baby’s mouth. Before feeding your baby, test the formula’s temperature by putting a few drops on your wrist. It should feel warm, not hot.\nAfter Feeding - Throw away any leftover formula because it now contains the baby’s saliva, which can cause bacteria to grow.\nStoring Opened Powdered Infant Formula - The package or container of infant formula must have information on how to store it before and after it is opened. It also must have information on when to throw away prepared formula. Follow the manufacturer’s directions on the label. Once a container of powdered formula is opened, the formula typically needs to be used within one month. Write the date that you opened the formula on the lid. With the lid tight, store in a cool dry place, not in the refrigerator.\n“Use By” Date - Don’t use a package or container of infant formula after this date. The manufacturer guarantees the nutrient content and quality of the formula only up to the “use by” date. FDA rules require a “use by” date on every container of infant formula.\nFreezing - Freezing is not recommended. It may cause the different parts of the formula to come apart and lower the quality.\nHomemade Formula - The FDA advises caretakers to not make or feed their infant homemade infant formula. Homemade infant formula recipes have not been evaluated by the FDA and may lack nutrients vital to an infant’s growth.\nCounterfeit (Fake) Formula - Formula products are sometimes taken from normal distribution channels and relabeled to fake the quality or identity of the product. Examples include changing the “use by” date or relabeling the product to hide the true content. This is illegal and can lead to serious health conditions for infants. A wide selection of infant formula is available on the market. If parents have questions about selecting a formula for their infant, they should ask their infant’s healthcare provider.\nFormula Changes - Check for any changes in formula color, smell, or taste. If you buy formula by the case, make sure the lot numbers and “use by” dates on the containers and boxes match. Also, check containers for damage, and call the manufacturer’s toll-free number with any concerns or questions. You can also contact FDA at 1-888-SAFEFOOD (1-888-723-3366).\n\nBabies at higher risk of getting Cronobacter are those:\n\nTwo months and younger, or\nWith weakened immune systems, or\nBorn prematurely, or\nWho are ill or receiving medical treatment, such as chemotherapy for cancer.\n\n\n\n\nBoth liquid ready-to-feed formula and liquid concentrate are made to be sterile (without germs) and are the safer options than powdered infant formula for higher risk infants not receiving breast milk.\n\n\n\nIf your baby is at higher risk for Cronobacter infections, take these extra steps:\n\nConsider using liquid ready-to-feed formula, as this is the safest option for formula-fed infants.\nIf you can’t obtain liquid ready-to-feed formula, consider using a liquid concentrate.\n\t\nIf using liquid concentrate formula and you are uncertain about the safety of your water source, be sure to boil the water for making formula, then let it cool in the pot for five minutes before putting it in the bottle. Add the liquid concentrate, shake to mix and allow the formula to cool to room temperature before feeding your infant.\n\n\nIf liquid ready-to-feed and liquid concentrate formulas are not available, use powdered infant formula.\n\t\nIf using powdered infant formula, boil water, let it cool in the pot for 5 minutes, then pour the amount stated on the label into the bottle. Shake to mix and allow the formula to cool to room temperature before feeding your infant.\n\n\nCertain metabolic and specialty products include statements on their packaging warning consumers against heating above 100°F, as this could result in a loss of vitamins and nutrients. Therefore, carefully follow the label’s instructions included on the packaging for specialty metabolic formulas.\nWhen cleaning the bottles and other feeding items, such as nipples, caps, rings, and valves, etc.\n\t\nWash them in a dishwasher using hot water and a heated drying cycle (or sanitizing setting), or\nWash them with soapy water in a basin used only for formula feeding parts, rinse, and air dry on a paper towel or clean dish towel.\n\n\nSanitize the feeding items before first use and once daily by:\n\t\nBoiling the loose feeding items in a pot of water for 5 minutes and remove them with clean tongs, or\nRunning them through a dishwasher, if one is available, with hot water and a heated drying cycle (sanitizing cycle), or\nSteaming in a microwave or a steaming appliance according to the maker’s instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information \n\nInfant Formula\nFood Safety for Infants & Toddlers\nSafe Feeding of Babies at Higher Risk of Foodborne Illness (Consumer Infographic)\nTips for Safely Preparing Powdered Infant Formula (Consumer Infographic)\nTips for Preparing Imported Infant Formula (Consumer Infographic)\nHelp Prevent Cronobacter Illness: Prepare and Store Powdered Infant Formula Safely (Consumer Infographic)\nInformation for Health Care Professionals on Safe Handling of Infant Formula\n\nTranslations \nen español (Spanish) \n\nLa fórmula infantil\nManipulación segura de la leche de fórmula infantil: Lo que necesita saber\nAlimentación segura de bebés con mayor riesgo de enfermedades transmitidas por los alimentos\nConsejos para preparar la leche de fórmula infantil en polvo de forma segura\nConsejos para preparar la fórmula infantil importada\nInformación para profesionales de la salud sobre la manipulación segura de la leche de fórmula infantil\n\nالعربية (Arabic)\n\nكيفية التعامل مع حليب الأطفال بأمان\nلرضاعة الآمنة للأطفال الأكثر عرضةللإصابة بالأمراض المنقولة بالغذاء\nنصائح لتحضير حليب الأطفالالمجفف بأمان\n\nမြန်မာ (Burmese)\n\nအစားအစာ အချက်အလက်များ \nအစာကြောင့်ဖြစ်သော ရောဂါဖြစ်နိုင်ခြေ မြင့်မားသော ကလေးငယ်များအား ဘေးကင်းစွာ ကျွေးမွေးခြင်း\nကလေးဖော်မြူလာနို့မှုန့်ကို ဘေးကင်းစွာ ဖျော်စပ်ပြင်ဆင်ခြင်းအတွက် အကြံပြုချက်များ\n\nدری (Dari)\n\nاستفاده مصئون از شیرخشک طفل نوزاد\nتغذیه مصئون اطفال نوزادی که در معرض خطر بلندتر امراض ناشی از غذا هستند\nنکاتی برای آماده کردن مصئونشیرخشک پودری طفل نوزاد\n\nनेपाली (Nepali) \n\nशिशुको फर्मुला सुरक्षित रूपमा ह्यान्डल गर्दै: के तपाईंले जान्न आवश्यक छ \nखाद्यजन्य रोगको उच्च जोखिममा रहेका बच्चाहरूलाई सुरक्षित खाना खुवाउनुहोस्\nसुरक्षित रूपमा तयारीका लागि सुझावहरू पाउडर गरिएको शिशु फर्मुला\n\nSoomaali (Somali) \n\nSi Nabdoon uga shaqaynta Caanaha Dhalaanka: Waxa aad U baahan tahay Inaad Ogaato\nQuudinta badbaadada leh ee dhallaanka khatarta sare ugu jira jirrooyinka cuntada ka dhasha\nTalooyinka sida Badbaadada leh Lagu diyaarinayo Caanaha Budada ah ee Dhalaanka"

        "content": "Español\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees manufacturers of infant formulas and helps ensure that these products are safe and support healthy growth in infants who consume them.\nDon’t Make Homemade Formula\nThe FDA advises parents and caregivers to not make or feed homemade infant formula to infants. Homemade infant formula recipes have not been evaluated by the FDA and may lack nutrients vital to an infant’s growth. It is important for parents and caregivers to remember that infant formula can be the sole source of nutrition for infants and is strictly regulated by the FDA.\nThe agency has requirements for certain nutrients in infant formulas sold in interstate commerce, and if the formula does not contain these nutrients at or above the minimum level or within its specified range, the infant formula is adulterated. The agency can take action to remove adulterated formula from the marketplace.\nThe agency has received reports of hospitalized babies who had been fed homemade infant formula and then suffered from hypocalcemia (low calcium). Other potential problems with homemade formulas include contamination and absence of, or inadequate amounts of, critical nutrients. These problems are serious, and the consequences may range from severe nutritional imbalances to foodborne illnesses, both of which can be life-threatening. Because of these severe health concerns, the FDA strongly advises parents and caregivers not to make and feed their infants homemade formulas.\nOther Safety Issues to Keep in Mind\nFormula Preparation: Use water from a safe source to mix with powdered infant formula. If you are not sure if your tap water is safe to use for preparing infant formula, contact your local health department or use bottled water. If your baby is very young (younger than 3 months old), was born prematurely, or has a weakened immune system, contact your infant’s pediatrician to find out if you need to take extra precautions in preparing your infant’s formula. Use the amount of water and number of powder scoops listed on the instructions of the infant formula label. Be sure to use the scoop provided by the manufacturer. Always measure the water first and then add the powder. If the formula is not being fed immediately, refrigerate it right away, keep refrigerated until feeding, and use within 24 hours. Discard any formula left in the bottle after your infant has finished a feeding.\nBottles & Nipples: Bottles, rings, caps, and nipples need to be clean and sanitized. To learn more about how to properly clean your baby’s bottles and other feeding supplies, visit the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) webpage “How to Clean, Sanitize, and Store Infant Feeding Items.”\nFormula Warming: This isn’t necessary. If you prefer to feed your infant warmed formula, place the bottle under running warm water, taking care to keep the water from getting into the bottle or on the nipple. Put a couple drops of the infant formula on the back of your hand to make sure it is lukewarm and not too hot. Never use a microwave oven for heating infant formulas. Microwaving may cause the bottle to remain cool while hot spots develop in the formula. Overheated formula can cause serious burns to your baby.\n“Use By” Date: This is the date up to which the manufacturer guarantees the nutrient content and the quality of the formula. After this date, a package or container of infant formula should not be fed to infants. FDA regulations require this date to be specified on each container of infant formula.\nStorage: Manufacturers must include instructions on infant formula packaging for its handling before and after the container is opened. They must also include information on the storage and disposal of prepared formula.\nFreezing Formula: This is not recommended, as it may cause the product’s components to separate.\nProducts on the Market\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about 6 months, followed by continued breastfeeding as other foods and drinks are introduced with continuation of breastfeeding for one year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant. While breastfeeding is strongly recommended and many mothers hope to breastfeed their infants, many infants in the U.S. rely on infant formula for some portion of their nutrition.\nInfant formula comes in three forms:\n\nPowder — Must be mixed with water before feeding.\nLiquid concentrate — Must be mixed with an equal amount of water before feeding.\nReady-to-feed — Requires no mixing.\n\nThe FDA’s nutrient specifications for infant formulas are set at levels to meet the nutritional needs of infants, and formula manufacturers generally set nutrient levels that are above the FDA minimum requirements. Thus, babies fed infant formulas do not need additional nutrients unless they are fed a low-iron formula.\nThe infant formulas currently available in the U.S. are labeled as either “Infant Formula with Iron” or “Additional Iron May Be Necessary.” The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that formula-fed infants receive an “Infant Formula with Iron” as a way of preventing iron-deficiency anemia.\nIf you have concerns about infant formula, contact your health care provider and FDA at 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332), or you can file a report online at MedWatch.\nSee this page for more questions and answers on infant formula, and click here to read the FDA’s safety alert for homemade infant formula. For more infant formula information resources, please see the FDA’s Infant Formula webpage."

        "content": "Food Safety for Moms-To-Be Main Page \nSend out those baby announcements - your bundle of joy has finally arrived! You've completed your first nine months of the journey. Now, here's how you, grandparents, and caregivers can help keep baby's food safe from here on...\nEn Español (Spanish)\n\nFoodborne illness is a serious health issue, especially for your new baby and any other children in your home. Each year in the U.S., 800,000 illnesses affect children under the age of 10. Infants and young children are particularly vulnerable to foodborne illness because their immune systems are not developed enough to fight off foodborne bacterial infections. That's why extra care should be taken when handling and preparing their food.\nInfants and young children are particularly vulnerable to foodborne illness because their immune systems are not developed enough to fight off foodborne bacterial infections. In fact, 800,000 illnesses affect children under the age of 10 in the U.S. each year.\nHandwashing\nYour First Step in Keeping Your Children Safe\nYour hands can pick up bacteria and spread bacteria to your baby - for example, from:\n\nDiapers containing feces and urine\nRaw meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs\nPets, such as dogs, cats, turtles, snakes, birds, and lizards.\nSoil\n\nWashing your hands can remove harmful bacteria, so wash your hands often to help prevent foodborne illness. Also, teach your children how and when to wash their hands.\n3 Critical Handwashing Steps\n\nWet your hands thoroughly with warm water and add soap.\nThoroughly scrub your hands, wrists, fingernails, and in between fingers - for at least 20 seconds.\nRinse, then dry hands with a clean cloth towel or use a paper towel so the germs are thrown away.\n\n\"Washing hands is one of the most important actions parents can take to prevent foodborne illness in their children.\" (FDA)\nWhen to Wash\n\nBefore and after handling food.\nAfter using the bathroom, changing diapers, or handling pets.\n\nWho's Not Washing?\nAccording to a Penn State University study on mothers with infants less than four months old:\n41% didn't wash their hands after petting animals;\n32% didn't wash their hands after changing the baby's diaper;\n15% didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom;\n10% didn't wash their hands after handling raw meat;\n5% didn't wash their hands after gardening or working with soil.\nFoodborne Illness: When to Call the Doctor\nPrevention is key to keeping your baby safe from infections. However, food-handling mistakes can happen. If your baby experiences any of the following symptoms, he or she may have foodborne illness and may need to see a doctor:\n\nBlood in diarrhea\nProlonged, high fever\nNot taking fluids\nNot able to keep anything down due to vomiting\n\nIn these cases, take your baby to a doctor or healthcare provider immediately. He or she can properly diagnose foodborne illness, have the specific bacteria identified if necessary, and prescribe the best treatment.\n\nHandling Baby's Food Safely...\nProtect your baby and young children by following these DOs and DON'Ts for preparing and handling their food safely.\nDOs:\n\nFollow the manufacturer's recommendations for preparing bottles before filling them with formula or milk. Observe \"use-by\" dates on formula cans.\nCheck to see that the safety button on the lid of commercial baby-food jars is down. If the jar lid doesn't \"pop\" when opened, don't use the product. Discard any jars with chipped glass or rusty lids.\nUse detergent and hot water to wash all blenders, food processors, and utensils (including the can opener) that come in contact with a baby's foods. Rinse well with hot water after washing.\nTransport bottles and food in an insulated cooler when traveling with the baby. Perishable items (milk, formula, or food) left out of the refrigerator or without a cold source for more than two hours should not be used. Cold temperatures keep most harmful bacteria from multiplying.\nFreeze homemade baby food by putting the mixture into an ice cube tray. Note: One cube equals one serving. Cover with heavy-duty plastic wrap and place the tray in the freezer. Once the food cubes are frozen, pop them into a freezer bag or airtight container and date it. Store for up to three months (discard unused food after three months). As an option, small jars can also be used for freezing. Leave about 1/2 inch of space at the top because food expands when frozen.\n\nDON'Ts:\n\nDon't make more formula than you will need. Formula can become contaminated during preparation. If a large quantity of formula is prepared and not properly refrigerated, bacteria can multiply to very large numbers. The more bacteria there are, the greater the chances for foodborne illness. Preparing formula in smaller quantities on an as-needed basis greatly reduces the possibility of contamination. If using powder, reconstitute immediately before feeding. If using liquid concentrates or ready-to-feed products, follow label instructions provided by the manufacturer.\nDon't put a bottle back in the refrigerator if the baby doesn't finish it. Harmful bacteria from a baby's mouth can be introduced into the bottle during feeding; they can grow and multiply even after refrigeration (some bacteria can grow at refrigerator temperatures) and reheating. The temperature that's needed to kill harmful bacteria is extremely high for consumption by a baby. Also, it's not a good idea to repeatedly reheat formula because lots of nutrients can be lost.\nDon't feed a baby from a jar of baby food and then put it in the refrigerator. Saliva on the spoon may contaminate the remaining food. Instead, put a serving size on a dish. Refrigerate the food remaining in the jar. Throw away the food in the serving dish that's not eaten.\nDon't use honey as a sweetener to entice babies to drink water from a bottle. Honey isn't safe for children less than a year old. It can contain the Clostridium botulinum organism that could cause serious illness or death.\nDon't give raw or unpasteurized milk or unpasteurized fruit or vegetable juice to infants or young children. Unpasteurized milk or juice may contain harmful bacteria. Unpasteurized juices are normally found in the refrigerated sections of grocery stores, health-food stores, cider mills, or farm markets. Such juices must have this warning on the label: WARNING: This product has not been pasteurized and therefore may contain harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness in children, older adults, and persons with weakened immune systems.\n\tNOTE: Juices that are fresh-squeezed and sold by the glass, such as at farmer's markets, at roadside stands, or in some juice bars, may not be pasteurized, or otherwise treated to ensure their safety. Warning labels are not required on these products. Young children should avoid these juices. If you can't tell if a juice has been processed to destroy harmful bacteria, either don't use the product or boil it to kill any harmful bacteria.\nDon't leave formula out at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Harmful bacteria can grow rapidly in food at room temperature. Discard formula that's been left out for more than two hours.\nDon't place dirty diapers in the same bag with bottles or food. Harmful bacteria from a dirty diaper can spread to baby's food.\nDon't give infants \"teas\" brewed from star anise. Brewed \"teas\" containing star anise have been associated with illnesses affecting infants. The illnesses ranged from serious neurological effects, such as seizures, to vomiting, jitteriness, and rapid eye movement.\n\nTwo Ways to Heat Breast Milk or Formula\n(for bottles with disposable inserts or hard plastic and glass bottles)\n\nIn Hot Tap Water\n\tPlace bottle under hot, running tap water until the desired temperature is reached. This should take one-to-two minutes.\nOn the Stove\n\tHeat water in a pan. Remove the pan from the heat and set the bottle in it until it's warm.\n\nSpecial Notes:\nWhen heating baby's milk, always shake the liquid to even out the temperature and test on top of your hand - not the wrist (this is one of the areas least sensitive to heat) - before feeding. Milk that's \"baby-ready\" should feel lukewarm.\nHeating breast milk or infant formula in the microwave is not recommended. Studies have shown that microwaves heat baby's milk and formula unevenly. This results in \"hot spots\" that can scald a baby's mouth and throat.\nSafe Microwaving of Solid Foods\nStudies show that the when baby food is microwaved in a jar, it's often heated unevenly. The hottest places are in the center of the foods. The coolest places are next to the glass sides, which could lead you to believe that the food is not too hot. Follow these precautions when microwaving baby's food.\n\nDon't microwave baby foods in the jar. Instead, transfer the food to a dish before microwaving it. This way the food can be stirred and taste-tested for temperature.\nMicrowave 4 ounces of solid food in a dish for about 15 seconds on high power. Always stir, let stand 30 seconds, and taste-test before feeding.\nDon't heat baby-food meats, meat sticks or eggs in the microwave. Use the stovetop instead. These foods have a high fat content, and since microwaves heat fats faster than other substances, these foods can cause splattering and overheating.\n\nSpecial Note: When heating baby's food, always stir, let stand 30 seconds, and taste-test before feeding. Food that's \"baby-ready\" should taste or feel lukewarm.\nHow to Store Breast Milk\nCareful home handling and storage of expressed breast milk is essential. Here’s how to safely store breast milk:\n\n\n\n\nType of Breast Milk\nCountertop 77°F (25°C) or colder (room temperature)\nRefrigerator 40°F (4°C)\nFreezer 0°F (-18°C) or colder\n\n\n\n\nFreshly expressed or pumped\nUp to 4 hours\nUp to 4 days with clean expression technique*\n\n**Use within 6 months is best;\n\t\t\tUp to 12 months is acceptable\n\n\n\nThawed, previously frozen\n1–2 hours\n\nUp to 1 day\n\t\t\t(24 hours)\n\nNever refreeze breast milk after it has thawed\n\n\nLeftover from a feeding(baby did not finish the bottle)\nOnce it has been offered to the infant, use leftovers within 2 hours or discard leftovers\nOnce it has been offered to the infant, use leftovers within 2 hours or discard leftovers\nOnce it has been offered to the infant, use leftovers within 2 hours or discard leftovers\n\n\n\n\n*Important: Before you express breast milk, wash your hands with soap and water. If soap and water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Make sure the area where you are expressing and your pump parts and bottles are clean. Breasts and nipples do not need to be washed before pumping.\n** Date your milk when you freeze it. Store breast milk in the back of the freezer, not in the freezer door. The door is the warmest spot in the freezer. This helps prevent unintentionally defrosting the milk, which can happen with frequent openings and closings of the door.\nSee CDC’s webpage on Proper Storage and Preparation of Breast Milk for additional information on storing, thawing, and feeding breast milk.\nSafe Storage of Baby Food\n\n\n\n\nLiquids (other than breast milk)\nRefrigerator\nFreezer\n\n\n\n\nFormula (stored in individual baby bottles)\n2 days\nNot recommended\n\n\nWhole milk\n5 days\n3 months\n\n\nReconstituted evaporated milk\n3 to 5 days\nNot recommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLIDS - opened or freshly made\nRefrigerator\nFreezer\n\n\n\n\nStrained fruits and vegetables\n2 to 3 days\n6 to 8 months\n\n\nStrained meats and eggs\n1 day\n1 to 2 months\n\n\nMeat/vegetable combinations\n1 to 2 days\n1 to 2 months\n\n\nHomemade baby foods\n1 to 2 days\n3 to 4 months\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Tips to Remember for Baby...\n\nDon't leave baby food solids or liquids out at room temperature for more than two hours.\nDon't put a bottle or baby-food back in the refrigerator if the baby doesn't finish it.\nTo reduce the risks of choking, be watchful of babies and young children while they are eating, and teach children to chew their food well.\n\t(In addition, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children younger than 4 years old not be fed any round, firm food unless it is cut into small pieces no larger than one-half inch.)\n\tFor more on choking, see MedlinePlus: Choking\nArsenic in Food and Dietary Supplements\n\nFor more information about infant formula and how to report problems, see Infant Formula.\nAdditional Information\n\nInfant and Toddler Nutrition (CDC)"

So are wipes intended for applying products such as sunless tanners or deodorants.\n\tThe law doesn’t require cosmetic products or ingredients, other than color additives, to have FDA approval before they go on the market.\nBut cosmetics must be safe when people use them as directed on the label, or in the customary or usual way. To learn more, see “FDA Authority Over Cosmetics.”\n\n\n\nWipes intended for a therapeutic purpose, such as killing germs on the skin, or treating acne, diaper rash, or other skin conditions, are drugs under the law. Drugs must meet requirements for FDA approval for safety and effectiveness before they go on the market. Drugs are regulated by FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\nWipes intended to control germs on inanimate surfaces (disinfect or sanitize) and wipes containing  insect repellents are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.\nWipes intended for cleansing objects in our homes, at work, the gym, and in public places are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nThe information below is about wipes that are regulated as cosmetics:\nWhat’s in a Wipe? \nCleansing wipes are made of materials such as polyester, polypropylene, cotton, wood pulp, or rayon fibers formed into sheets. They may be packaged individually, or in small or bulk packaging. They are moistened with water and other ingredients, such as cleansing and moisturizing agents that help them work. They may contain other ingredients, such as preservatives to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.\nWipes are sometimes labeled as scented, unscented, or fragrance-free. FDA doesn’t have regulations governing the use of these terms. But cosmetic labeling is required to be truthful and not misleading.\nTypically, the word “unscented” on a cosmetic label means that the product doesn’t have a noticeable scent. But it may actually contain “masking” fragrance ingredients to hide the smell of ingredients whose scent may be unpleasant.\nHowever, because the term “fragrance” refers to specific kinds of ingredients, cosmetics labeled as “fragrance free” should not contain any added fragrance ingredients. It’s possible that a product labeled as “fragrance free” may have a noticeable scent, either pleasant or unpleasant, resulting from other ingredients.\nIf a product contains fragrance ingredients, the list of ingredients must say so. Fragrance ingredients may be identified by name or simply as “fragrance.” To learn more, see “Fragrances in Cosmetics.”\nUsing Wipes Safely: Tips for Consumers\nHow consumers use and store wipes can affect their safety. Here are some safety tips:\n\nUse wipes only on unbroken, intact skin.\nUse wipes only for their intended use, following all directions on the label. For example, there may be a warning not to use the wipes on broken or irritated skin or the directions may recommend rinsing the skin after use.\nMake sure to let skin dry thoroughly after using wipes.\nKeep containers tightly closed to keep wipes from drying out.\nDiscard used wipes immediately to prevent cross contamination, and as directed on the label. Some, but not all, are labeled as flushable.\nAs with all cosmetics, store wipes properly. If they are exposed to temperature extremes, such as in a hot or cold car, they may dry out, or the temperature extremes can cause changes in the ingredients. For example, the preservatives that protect against bacteria and mold may break down and not be able to do their job. Also, bacteria and mold may grow faster in a warm place.\nIf you have sensitive skin or certain allergies, check the list of ingredients on the label before using wipes. FDA requires this list for all cosmetics marketed on a retail basis to consumers. The list can help you to identify ingredients you want to avoid. Remember that not all people react to the same things. For example, some parents have suffered reactions to baby wipes that didn’t bother their babies.\nStay informed. When FDA becomes aware of a health problem, we alert the public. For example, there have been recalls of some wipes that were contaminated with bacteria or mold. You can keep up with cosmetic safety information by checking our “What’s New” page, subscribing to email updates or following FDA cosmetics news on Twitter .  \n\nReporting a Problem\nIf you observe a rash, such as raised red bumps, either smooth or crusty, redness, irritation, or burning of the skin in the area(s) where wipes contact the skin, stop using the wipes and contact your healthcare provider right away.\nAlso, please report the problem to FDA. Your report helps FDA determine whether or not we need to take action to protect public health.

        "topic": "Should you put sunscreen on infants? Not usually",
        "content": "Español\nWhen you go outdoors with your infant, whether for a quick stroll in the park or a day at the beach, it’s important to keep your little one out of the sun. But should you put sunscreen on your baby to protect them from the sun’s bright rays? Not usually.\nYour infant’s sensitive skin is vulnerable to serious burns. But sunscreen isn’t the answer, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That’s because infants are at greater risk than adults of sunscreen side effects, such as a rash.\nThe FDA and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend keeping newborns and babies younger than 6 months out of direct sunlight. The best sun protection for these infants is to stay in the shade. Look for natural shade, such as under a tree. Or create your own shade under a beach umbrella, a pop-up tent, or a stroller canopy.\nIt’s especially important to keep your baby out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun is at its strongest and ultraviolet (UV) rays are most intense. If you do need to be outside in the sun during those times, be sure to take extra precautions. And check with your pediatrician before applying sunscreen to children younger than 6 months.\nDress Your Baby Properly: Cover Up\nThe AAP suggests dressing infants in lightweight clothing, such as long pants and long-sleeve shirts. Babies should wear a hat with a brim that shades the neck to prevent sunburn. Not baseball caps, which don’t shade the neck or ears, both of which are sensitive areas for a baby. And for fabrics, tight weaves are better than loose ones.\nSummer’s heat presents other challenges for babies. Our sweat naturally cools us down when we’re hot. But younger babies don’t sweat like adults do. Their bodies haven’t fully developed that built-in heating-and-cooling system, so they can become easily overheated – and have a greater risk of becoming dehydrated.\nSun Safety Tips for Infants\nHere are some things to keep in mind this summer when outside with infants younger than 6 months:\n\nKeep your baby in the shade as much as possible.\nTalk to your pediatrician before using any sunscreen on your baby.\nMake sure your child wears clothing that covers and protects his or her sensitive skin. If you hold the fabric against your hand and it’s sheer enough to see through it, it probably doesn’t offer enough protection.\nMake sure your baby wears a hat that provides shade to the face, neck, and ears.\nWatch your baby carefully for warning signs of sunburn or dehydration. These signs include fussiness, redness, and excessive crying.\nIf your baby is becoming sunburned, get out of the sun right away and apply cold compresses to the affected areas. Call your baby’s pediatrician right away.\nHydrate! Give your child formula or breast milk if you’re out in the sun for more than a few minutes. \nRemember to pack a cooler to store the liquids."

        "topic": "Should Your Child Participate in a Clinical Trial?",
        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspañol\nClinical trials help provide reliable evidence needed when studying medical products to diagnose, prevent, treat, and sometimes even cure, childhood diseases. Children who participate in these research studies may also potentially benefit from the medical products under investigation.\nBefore deciding whether your child should participate in a clinical trial, there’s a lot to know, including the risks and benefits. Let’s take a look.\nClinical Trials Can Help Improve Medical Treatments\nClinical trials are voluntary research studies conducted in people and designed to answer specific questions about the safety and/or effectiveness of new drugs, vaccines, and medical devices.\nInterventional studies may also seek to answer questions about new ways of using existing products that are approved, cleared or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for certain uses.\nIf your child enrolls in a pediatric clinical trial, they could be offered an experimental product that may (or may not) be better than those already being used. Generally speaking, by law, giving an experimental product to children must provide a potential clinical benefit that justifies the risk of using the experimental product. Also, the children who participate in the clinical trial generally must have the disease or condition being studied.\nUnder limited circumstances, children may be exposed to the risks of an experimental medical product that does not offer any potential clinical benefit. In that case, the risks must be sufficiently low and the information to be gained must be important to understanding or treating the children’s disease or condition.\nClinical studies give us important information about the safety and effectiveness of an experimental medical product. This information informs the FDA’s review of medical products. In addition, it guides whatever information goes in the approved, cleared, or licensed product labeling, including, for example, about the right dose of a drug to use.\nThe Importance of Clinical Trials in Children\nNot all drugs or devices approved, licensed, cleared or authorized for marketing by the FDA have been labeled for use in children. So, by necessity, doctors may routinely treat children with a drug or device that has been studied in adults and approved for adult use but may not have been studied in children, or may have been studied in a different group of children. For example, a drug may have been evaluated in adolescents but not in newborns.\nChildren’s responses to medical products can’t always be predicted from data collected in studies of adults. As children grow, their bodies change. Those changes can mean children of different ages may experience differences in the effectiveness or side effects of a medical product and, for example, may need a different dosage.\nFor devices, clinical trials may also be needed to verify design modifications for children and to establish age-appropriate use of the device. Designing a medical device for children can be challenging because children are often smaller and more active than adults.\nMedical devices may be diagnostic or therapeutic. Some devices may require different settings and algorithms to ensure they are safe and effective for children. Others may be implanted and may need to be adjusted as a child grows. Adult data may not always predict the potential risks in children.\nHow Clinical Trials Are Conducted\nSafeguards are in place to ensure the rights and well-being of children in clinical trials. Depending on the type of clinical trial and the product being evaluated, a child may get an investigational product, an approved, cleared, or licensed product known to be effective, or an inactive substance or device (placebo).\nIn a clinical trial, children may not be deprived of a treatment necessary for their health. So, in some cases the investigational product a child receives in a clinical trial may be added to the treatment they are already receiving for their condition, unless the risks of stopping the established treatment are low. For example, if the child has seizures and is taking a particular drug that helps control the seizures, they would likely continue to take that drug and also take the investigational product (or placebo) being studied in the clinical trial to treat seizures.\nA clinical trial that evaluates an investigational product might be no riskier than your child being treated with an FDA-approved, cleared, licensed or authorized product that has not been evaluated in children. For one, monitoring for possible side effects (also known as adverse events) generally would be much more intensive in a research study than when a drug is prescribed, or a device used, by a doctor outside of a clinical trial.\nWhat You Should Know Before Enrolling Your Child in a Clinical Trial\nTalk with your child’s pediatrician before enrolling in, and during, a clinical trial. Your health care professional can serve as an adviser to your family and help you evaluate the potential benefits and risks of the study.\nThey can help you think about important questions to ask the investigator in charge of the clinical trial and decide if it is right for your child. The people doing the research study may include doctors, nurses, research coordinators, social workers and other health care professionals.\nEnrolling your child a clinical trial is an important decision. Learn as much as you can beforehand.\nAsk questions. Write down a list of questions and take it with you when you meet with the investigator in charge of the clinical trial. Some examples include:\n\nWhat is the evidence that the investigational product might help my child?\nHow will you check to see if the investigational product is working?\nAre there any concerns that the investigational product could be unsafe?\nHow closely will my child be monitored if there are problems?\nWho do I call if I’m concerned that there is a problem?\n\nTake notes during the discussion. Read the notes back to the investigator to make sure you heard everything correctly. Ask, “Can I tell you what I think this is about, and you tell me if I’m right or not?”\nAsk for contact information if you would like to talk to other parents whose children are participating in the clinical trial. The study team can provide this information if they get permission from other parents to have you contact them.\nTake your time. Before signing the informed consent document, think about it. Talk it over with your child, your family, your child’s health care professional and other trusted people before signing.\nFollow your instincts. If you’re not satisfied with the information given to you and the answers to your questions, don’t enroll your child.\nClinical trials are voluntary. After you enroll in a study, you can take your child out of the clinical trial at any time. It’s important to talk to the study team if you want to stop participating in the trial. You may need to follow up even after stopping to make sure your child does not have any side effects from the investigational product.\nYou can search for clinical studies at ClinicalTrials.gov.​"

For those reasons, it’s important to know when your child needs medication, which treatments are recommended, and when to do without medicine.\nThese days, cold and cough symptoms can be especially worrisome, because they could be symptoms of COVID-19, the flu, or other potentially serious illness. If you are concerned about COVID-19, talk to your child’s health care provider.\nWays to Treat Colds in Infants and Children\nCoughs are a normal symptom of a cold and help the body clear the mucus out of the airway and protect the lungs. Non-drug treatments for coughs include drinking plenty of fluids, especially warm drinks to soothe the throat.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration offers these tips for relieving cough and cold symptoms in infants and children:\nA cool mist humidifier makes breathing easier by decreasing congestion in nasal passages. Do not use warm mist humidifiers because they can cause nasal passages to swell and make breathing more difficult. \nSaline nose drops or sprays keep nasal passages moist and help avoid stuffiness. \nNasal suctioning with a bulb syringe or a similar product, with or without saline nose drops, works very well for children younger than a year old. You can use them on older children, too, but they often resist bulb syringes.\nAcetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used to reduce fever, aches, and pain. Carefully read and follow the product’s instructions on the Drug Facts label or talk to your pharmacist or health care provider about dosage. \nEncourage children to drink plenty of liquids to stay hydrated.\nGiving Children Cough and Cold Medicines\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are available to treat cough and cold symptoms. The FDA doesn’t recommend OTC medicines for cough and cold symptoms in children younger than 2 because they could cause serious and potentially life-threatening side effects. Manufacturers voluntarily label these cough and cold products to state: “Do not use in children under 4 years of age.” \nNumerous OTC cough and cold products contain many ingredients that can lead to accidental overdosing. Learn about what drugs (active ingredients) are in a product by reading the Drug Facts label.\nNonprescription cough and cold products can be harmful to children if:\n\nThey get more than the recommended dose or take the medicine too often.\nThey take more than one product containing the same drug. For example, taking both a pain reliever containing acetaminophen and cough and cold medicine containing acetaminophen.  \n\nHow can you be sure to give the correct dose? The FDA encourages drug manufacturers to provide a dosing instrument, such as a syringe or a cup, marked with the correct measurements. Use them—and not household spoons or tools from other medications—to measure medication.\nDon’t give children medicines that are packaged and made for adults because adult medicines may overdose a child.\nThere Are No FDA-Approved Homeopathic Products\nAt your pharmacy and online, you may see other cough and cold medicine being sold for children advertised as homeopathic. It’s important to note that these homeopathic products are drugs because they are intended to treat or mitigate colds, even though some of these products might look similar to dietary supplements.\nHomeopathic products are generally labeled as containing very small amounts of highly diluted substances, including ingredients from plants, animal or human sources, bacteria, minerals, and chemicals. The FDA has found that some of these products contain active drug ingredients in levels that far exceed the amount stated on the product’s label, and could cause significant harm to children.\nThere are no FDA-approved homeopathic products, and homeopathic products sold in the U.S. have not met the FDA’s requirements for safety and effectiveness. The FDA is not aware of any proven benefits of these products and urges you not to give homeopathic cough and cold medicine to children younger than 4.\nIn certain instances, children younger than 4 who took these products have experienced serious side effects, some of which required hospitalization, including:\n\nSeizure, allergic reaction, and difficulty breathing.\nLow blood potassium and low blood sugar, which may result in headache, crankiness, drowsiness, and weakness.\n\nThese serious side effects occurred soon after children took a homeopathic cough and cold product; however, it is not always possible to know whether a reported side effect was caused by a medicine.\nWhen to Call a Doctor\nNot every sniffle or cough merits a trip to the doctor’s office. When in doubt, call your health care provider. \nSome symptoms can signal that your child may have something more serious than a cold. For all children, call a doctor if you see any of these symptoms:\n\nA fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in an infant 2 months or younger.\nA fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in children at any age.\nBlue lips.\nLabored breathing, including nostrils widening with each breath; wheezing; fast breathing; the ribs showing with each breath; or shortness of breath.\nSevere headache.\nNot eating or drinking, with signs of dehydration (such as decreased urination).\nExcessive crankiness or sleepiness.\nPersistent ear pain.\nIf the child is getting worse."

        "topic": "Accidental Exposures to Fentanyl Patches Continue to Be Deadly to Children",
        "content": "Español\nAccidental exposure to medication is a leading cause of poisoning in children. Young children, in particular, have died or become seriously ill after being exposed to a skin patch containing fentanyl, a powerful opioid pain reliever. If you suspect that a child has been exposed to a fentanyl patch, call 911 and seek emergency medical help immediately.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration urges parents and caregivers to take precautions and make sure that these patches are stored, used and disposed of properly. Below are some ways to reduce the risk of exposure and safely dispose of these patches – and what to do if a child is exposed to a fentanyl patch.\nChildren Can Overdose on Fentanyl Patches\nThe fentanyl transdermal system, which is marketed under the brand name Duragesic and is also available as a generic product, is a patch prescribed by health care professionals to be applied to the skin. The patch treats opioid-tolerant patients who need daily, round-the-clock, long-term pain medicine by releasing fentanyl through the skin over the course of the treatment. The patch is generally replaced every three days.\nChildren can overdose on new and used fentanyl patches by putting them in their mouth or sticking the patches on their skin. This can cause death by slowing the child’s breathing and decreasing the levels of oxygen in their blood.\nThe FDA has warned – and continues to warn – patients, caregivers and health care professionals about the dangers of accidental exposure to the fentanyl patch, and of the need to properly store and dispose of the product.\nIn addition, the FDA recommends that patients and caregivers talk to their health care professionals about having naloxone on hand. Naloxone is a life-saving drug that, when sprayed into the nose or injected, can quickly reverse the powerful effects of opioids, including fentanyl, during an overdose. Naloxone can be given to children and anyone who may have been exposed to a fentanyl patch.\nCut the Risk of Accidental Exposure\nIf you or someone in your home uses the fentanyl patch, follow the instructions given by the prescriber and in the Medication Guide, which should accompany each fentanyl patch prescription.\nTo reduce the chance that children will be exposed to fentanyl patches, take these precautions:\n\nKeep fentanyl patches and other drugs in a secure location out of children’s sight and reach. Consider keeping fentanyl patches in a lockbox. Toddlers and young children may think the patch is a sticker, bandage or temporary tattoo.\nConsider covering the fentanyl patch with a transparent adhesive film dressing to make sure the patch doesn’t come off your body. You can apply first-aid tape to the edges of the patch to secure it to your skin.\nThroughout the day, make sure the patch is still in place, by touching it or looking at it to make sure it hasn’t fallen off.\nWhen you apply a new patch, promptly dispose of the used one properly.\n\nInfants and toddlers are especially at risk of accidental exposure to fentanyl. When children are held by or are sleeping with adults wearing a patch, it is possible that the medicine from a partially detached patch could be transferred from adult to child.\nHow to Dispose of Fentanyl Patches\nEven after a patch is used, there is enough fentanyl left to cause illness, overdose or death in babies, children, pets and others who are accidentally exposed to the medicine in the patch. That’s why the drug comes with special instructions on how to dispose of used or leftover patches.\nThe FDA recommends promptly disposing of used patches by folding them in half with the sticky sides together, and then flushing them down a toilet. Patches should not be placed in the household trash, where children or pets can find them. Children may find lost, discarded or improperly stored patches and ingest them or stick them on themselves or others.\nThe FDA has included fentanyl patches on a list of medicines that should be flushed down a toilet because they could be especially harmful, and possibly fatal, in a single dose if used by someone other than the person for whom the medicine was prescribed.\nWhat to Do if a Child Is Exposed to Fentanyl\nIf you suspect that a child has been exposed to a fentanyl patch, use naloxone if you have it, call 911, and seek emergency medical help immediately.\nEarly signs of fentanyl exposure might be hard to notice in young children. Drowsiness has been among the reported symptoms, and that could be misinterpreted as the child just being tired or sleepy.\nOther signs that a child may have been exposed to fentanyl include:\n\ntrouble breathing\nshortness of breath\nswelling of the face, tongue or throat\nagitation\nhigh body temperature\nstiff muscles\n\nFDA-approved naloxone products, including nasal sprays and injections, are important tools to reverse overdose in both health care and community settings. You can give naloxone to people of all ages, from infants to elderly adults. Even if you use naloxone, you still need to call 911 and seek emergency medical help right away.\nTalk to your health care professional about the benefits of naloxone and how to obtain it.\nHave Naloxone and Learn How to Use It\nIf you have naloxone, tell your family about it. Keep naloxone where family, friends and close contacts can easily get it in an emergency. Advise them how to administer naloxone in case of an opioid overdose.\nIf you have questions about the fentanyl patch, talk to your health care professional or pharmacist. Also, the FDA’s Division of Drug Information (DDI) will answer almost any drug question. DDI pharmacists are available by email, druginfo@fda.hhs.gov, and by phone, 1-855-543-DRUG (3784) and 301-796-3400.\nHealth care professionals and patients should report cases of accidental exposure of fentanyl patches or other medications to the FDA’s MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program:\n\nComplete and submit the report online.\nDownload the form or call 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form, then complete and return to the address on the form or submit by fax to 1-800-FDA-0178."

        "topic": "Vaccines protect children from harmful infectious diseases",
        "content": "Español\nVaccines are essential to getting children off to a healthy start in life and keeping them healthy as they grow up.\nBecause immunization programs of the 20th and 21st centuries have been so successful, many parents today have never seen the many vaccine-preventable diseases that were once common. They may not realize that those infectious diseases could reemerge. If individuals choose not to vaccinate themselves or their children, some diseases that are now rare or nonexistent in the U.S. may resurface.\nInfectious diseases that used to be common in children in the U.S. – including measles, polio, diphtheria, rubella (German measles) and chickenpox – are preventable with vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Vaccines can prevent contagious diseases that once killed or harmed many infants, children and adults. The FDA ensures that the vaccines we approve or authorize for emergency use in the U.S. meet our safety and effectiveness standards, as well as standards for quality.\nFrom babies to teenagers, people need vaccines throughout childhood to protect them from potentially dangerous infectious diseases. Without vaccines, children would be at risk for serious illness – and even disability or death – from diseases such as measles, whooping cough, or meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).\nA vaccine is a medical product. Like any medicine, vaccines can cause side effects, but most are minor and short-lived, such as a low-grade fever, or pain and redness at the injection site.\nSevere, long-lasting side effects of vaccines are rare.\nThe risk of being harmed by vaccines is much smaller than the risk of serious illness from the diseases they prevent. Ensuring the safety and effectiveness of vaccines is one of the FDA’s top priorities.\nThe FDA ensures that the vaccines we approve or authorize for emergency use have undergone a rigorous and extensive development program. This includes studies conducted by the manufacturers to show that the vaccines meet FDA standards for quality and for safety and effectiveness in the target population. The FDA has extensive expertise in clinical trial design and methods, and manufacturers conduct clinical trials according to plans that have been evaluated by the FDA. The FDA approves or authorizes a vaccine only if it determines that the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its risks.\nIf you have questions about vaccines, visit the FDA’s guide for parents and caregivers. It describes in more detail the routinely administered vaccines for children and provides answers to commonly asked questions. Also, a health care professional is the best resource for information about vaccines.\nIn the meantime, here are some tips to keep in mind when your child is vaccinated.\nReview the Vaccine Information Statements.\nProduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Vaccine Information Statements explain both the benefits and risks of a vaccine to vaccine recipients. The health care professional administering the vaccine is required by law to provide them to you.\nTalk to a health care professional about the benefits and risks of vaccines.\nLearn the facts about the benefits and risks of vaccines, along with the potential consequences of not vaccinating against diseases. Some people are surprised to learn that children can be harmed by or even die of measles, diphtheria, whooping cough and other infectious diseases that can be prevented by vaccines.\nBefore vaccination, tell the health care professional about certain conditions and allergies.\nThe health care professional administering the vaccine should be informed if your child is sick, or if they have a history of certain allergic or other bad side effects to previous vaccinations or their components. For example, eggs are used to produce some influenza (flu) vaccines. Tell the health care professional if your child has a severe allergy to eggs.\nSome vaccines are supplied in vials or prefilled syringes that may contain natural rubber latex, which can cause allergic reactions in people who are sensitive to latex. Let the health care professional know about an allergy to latex.\nIt is also important to discuss with the health care professional which vaccines should or should not be given to children who have a weakened immune system.\nReport problems and side effects.\nVaccines are safe, and severe side effects are rare. But if you have any concerns after receiving a vaccine, contact a health care professional.\nThe FDA closely monitors the safety of vaccines after they are approved or authorized for emergency use. One way we accomplish this is by collecting reports of possible side effects (also known as adverse events). Side effects should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This is a national vaccine safety surveillance program co-monitored by the FDA and the CDC.\nVAERS is a system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines approved or authorized in the U.S. VAERS encourages you to report any medically important adverse event occurring after the administration of vaccines. An adverse event can be reported even if it is uncertain or unlikely that the vaccine caused it. A health care provider can file this report, or you can do it yourself.\nVAERS does not give medical advice. Reporting to VAERS is unlikely to answer the question of why an individual experienced an adverse event after vaccination, or whether the vaccine caused the adverse event. But it helps FDA doctors and scientists identify potential safety concerns promptly for further study. If it is determined that additional studies are needed, the results of the studies help the FDA assess if the vaccine causes the adverse event. The FDA and CDC do not contact every individual who reports an adverse event to VAERS, but some individuals may be contacted if follow-up information is needed.\nVisit the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov to report possible side effects or other problems related to vaccines. You can report a problem online, download a form, or call 1-800-822-7967 for more information."

        "topic": "Cord blood banking",
        "content": "July 23, 2012\nExpecting a baby can be a very exciting time for soon-to-be-parents. It can also be very confusing, with many decisions to make. One choice prospective parents often face is whether to donate, bank or discard their baby's cord blood. Did you know that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates cord blood? Here is some information for expectant parents about the regulations in place designed to help ensure the safety of cord blood for transplantation.\nWhat is cord blood?\nCord blood is the blood contained in the placental blood vessels and umbilical cord, which connects an unborn baby to the mother's womb. Cord blood contains hematopoietic progenitor cells. At birth, cord blood can be collected (or \"recovered\") from the umbilical cord.\nWhat are hematopoietic progenitor cells?\nHematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are blood-forming stem cells. HPCs are found in bone marrow, peripheral blood, and cord blood. These types of stem cells are routinely used to treat patients with cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, and other disorders of the blood and immune systems.\nHow are patients and donated cord blood units “matched” so that a unit of cord blood can be used for a patient’s transplant? \nHuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is used to match patients and donors for cord blood transplants. HLAs are proteins found on most cells in the body. A person’s immune system uses these proteins as markers to recognize which cells belong in their body and which do not. A close match between the patient’s and the donor's HLA markers can reduce the risk that the patient’s immune cells will attack the donor's cells, or that the donor's immune cells will attack the patient’s body after the transplant.\nHow are HPCs from cord blood different than HPCs from other sources?\nThere is evidence that cord blood HPCs may not require as exact a match as HPCs from bone marrow or the bloodstream because the antigens in cord blood are less mature. This suggests that transplants involving compatible HPCs from cord blood may be less likely to cause adverse reactions because the donor’s cells are less likely to see the patient’s cells as foreign bodies and attack them.\nWhat are the options for cord blood banking?\nCord blood can be donated to a public cord blood bank, where it will be stored for potential future use by anyone who may need it. Alternatively, parents may arrange for the cord blood to be stored in a private cord bank, for potential use if it is later needed for treatment of the child from whom it was recovered, or for use in first- or second-degree relatives. Information on cord blood donation options may be found on the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) web site.\nYou may also wish to consult your health care provider about the options.\nHow does FDA regulate cord blood stored for personal or family use? \nCord blood stored for personal use and for use in first- or second-degree relatives that also meets other criteria in FDA’s regulations does not require approval before use. Private cord banks must still comply with other FDA requirements, including establishment registration and listing, donor screening and testing for infectious diseases (except when used for the original donor), reporting and labeling requirements, and compliance with current good tissue practice regulations. \nHow does FDA regulate cord blood intended for use in patients unrelated to the donor (i.e., cord blood stored in public banks)?\nCord blood stored for potential future use by a patient unrelated to the donor meets the definition of “drug” under the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and “biological product” under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. Cord blood in this category must meet additional requirements and be licensed under a biologics license application (BLA), or subject to an investigational new drug application (IND) before use.\nAre there any FDA approved uses for cord blood?\nCord blood can be used in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation procedures in patients with some disorders affecting the hematopoietic (blood forming) system. For example, cord blood transplants have been used to treat patients with certain blood cancers and some inherited metabolic and immune system disorders.\nIf a cord blood bank is registered with FDA, does that mean that the cord bank is FDA approved?\nEstablishments that perform any of the manufacturing steps for cord blood must register with FDA and list their products and each of the manufacturing steps they perform. Registration with FDA doesn't mean a firm is \"endorsed\" by the agency, it simply means the firm has notified FDA that it is performing one or more manufacturing steps.\nFDA’s website has a searchable database that includes information on registered cord blood banks.\nDoes FDA inspect facilities that store cord blood?\nYes. Registered establishments are subject to FDA inspection to ensure they are complying with the regulations. The inspections of private banks are designed to ensure prevention of infectious disease transmission.\nWhere can I get more information about donating my baby's cord blood?\nTo make your baby's cord blood available for use by anyone who needs a cord blood transplant, you may donate it to a public cord blood bank. Information on donating cord blood to a public cord blood bank is also found on the HRSA web site.\nWhere can I get more information about banking my baby's cord blood?\nTo make your baby's cord blood available for use by the child from whom it was recovered, or for use in first- or second-degree relatives, you may bank it with a private cord blood bank. Information on banking cord blood with a private cord blood bank is also found on the HRSA web site.\nFor some diseases, such as genetically heritable diseases, in the event that your child would need treatment, it is possible that the cord blood would not be recommended for such use.\nWhere can I get more information about FDA's regulations?\nInformation about the regulation of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products including cord blood is available on FDA's web site."

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t  The FDA has been alerting people who use Philips Respironics ventilators, BiPAP, and CPAP machines and their health care providers that Philips Respironics has recalled certain devices due to potential health risks. We have answers to your questions related to this recall.\n\t\n\nEspañol\nDo you feel tired or have a headache when you wake up in the morning?  Something might be going wrong while you sleep that you don’t know about: obstructive sleep apnea (pronounced app-nee-uh).\nWhat is Obstructive Sleep Apnea?\nThe Greek word \"apnea\" means \"without breath.\"  An apnea is defined as a pause in breathing for at least 10 seconds. Obstructive sleep apnea, also called OSA, causes you to stop breathing in your sleep for several seconds, up to many times an hour.\nPeople diagnosed with OSA have at least five breathing pauses an hour and can have many more. During these breathing pauses, your brain, heart, kidneys, and other essential organs do not get enough oxygen, and carbon dioxide can build up in your body. When your brain notices there is not enough oxygen and too much carbon dioxide in your body, it sends out a signal to take a breath. You wake up enough to take a few breaths, but not enough to remember it the next morning. This cycle repeats itself many times each night, making you feel tired or exhausted in the morning.\nWhen you have OSA, the apnea is caused by an obstruction or blockage. Usually the blockage is tongue muscles, soft palate or parts of your throat that relax too much during sleep and block your airway. A less common form of sleep apnea, called central sleep apnea, happens if the area of your brain that controls breathing does not send the correct signals to the muscles that help you breathe.\nIf you have OSA, a person sleeping near you may notice that you snore loudly, and occasionally pause breathing and make a snort or choking sound when you start breathing again. These symptoms may happen less often or go unnoticed in women with OSA. Other symptoms include:\n\nMore than usual daytime sleepiness\nWaking up with a dry throat or headache\nWaking up often during the night\nWaking up often during the night to urinate\nDifficulty concentrating or mood changes during the day\n\nTalk to your doctor if you experience symptoms of sleep apnea. The diagnosis of a sleep disorder such as OSA requires a sleep study done in a sleep lab or at home. A diagnosis will determine if your OSA is mild, moderate, or severe based on the average number of times you pause breathing each hour during sleep.\nGetting Treatment\nThere are treatments for OSA that work well. Eric Mann, M.D., Ph.D. at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health says, “Many FDA-approved and FDA-cleared devices can help people with OSA wake up in the mornings feeling rested and refreshed, improving their overall health.”\nGetting treatment for OSA is key because OSA not only affects your sleep but also increases your risk of serious health problems and even death. Chronic (ongoing), untreated OSA may increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, type 2 diabetes, glaucoma, and some types of cancer along with other serious health conditions. Lifestyle behavior changes such as losing weight, drinking less alcohol, stopping smoking, and using devices that help you sleep in a certain position may help improve OSA, but may not make it go away entirely. Taking certain medicines, such as sedatives or sleep aids, that slow or lessen breathing can also contribute to OSA. Talk to your doctor before stopping or starting any medicine.\nOSA treatments can work well to manage OSA, but not every treatment is right for everyone. Some treatments work best for people with mild OSA while others are best for people with more severe OSA. Some treatments involve surgery to correct a narrow airway or a specific part of the airway that may collapse during sleep. Any type of surgery has risks, so talk with your doctor about all of your options before you decide.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration evaluates the safety and effectiveness of certain medical devices before they can be marketed to the public, including the device most often used for OSA treatment (CPAP machine).  Depending on your health status and the type of OSA you may have, your doctor may prescribe one of these OSA treatments.\nOSA Treatment Options\nCPAP Machine\nThe most common OSA treatment is for you to use a continuous positive airway pressure machine, commonly known as a CPAP machine, every night during sleep. CPAPs use air pressure to keep your airways open during sleep. The air is delivered through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth, or only your nose. CPAPs are considered the standard treatment for OSA, but you may need to work with a doctor or technician for a few weeks to find the best combination of CPAP settings and that are both comfortable and effective for you.\nBiPAP Machine\nSome people may not be able to use a CPAP machine due to the amount of continuous pressure. As a result, your doctor may prescribe a bilevel positive airway pressure, or BiPAP, machine. A BiPAP machine delivers different air pressure levels for inhaling and exhaling. CPAPs deliver the same amount of air pressure whether you are inhaling or exhaling.\nNasal Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (EPAP)\nThis alternative treatment uses disposable or reusable valves inserted into or over the nostrils during sleep. The valves limit your exhalations or breaths out, which helps maintain pressure in your airway to keep it open during sleep. Unlike a CPAP machine, EPAP valves do not need power from an electrical outlet or batteries.\nOral Appliance\nA prescription-only oral appliance is worn during sleep and fits like a sports mouth guard or an orthodontic retainer but is for both the top and bottom teeth. It keeps your jaw positioned forward so that your airway stays open while you sleep. A dentist takes impressions of your teeth so a custom device can be made and fitted for you.\nTongue Retaining Device\nThis type of oral appliance is worn in the mouth during sleep and includes a part that prevents your tongue from falling back into the airway during sleep.\nNeuromuscular Tongue Muscle Stimulator\nA neuromuscular tongue muscle stimulator is a prescription-only device you put in your mouth for 20 minutes a day while you are awake. The device delivers mild electrical currents to your tongue muscle, strengthening it so that it does not relax and block your airway as much during sleep.\nImplantable Nerve Stimulator\nThe FDA approved a medical device for OSA that can be surgically implanted during an outpatient procedure. A surgeon implants the device, which is similar to a pacemaker, on the upper chest below the collarbone. During surgery the doctor places wires from the implant that lead (under the skin of the neck) to the nerves that control your tongue and nearby muscles. The implant sends mild electrical impulses through the wires to nerves that control your tongue muscles during sleep.  The nerve stimulation prevents your tongue and the muscles around it from collapsing and blocking your airway during sleep. Most implants have a remote control you use to turn the device on before going to sleep and turn off after waking up.\nPosition Therapy Device (a pillow or similar device)\nA special pillow or other bed device may help mild to moderate positional OSA. Positional obstructive sleep apnea is caused by lying on your back (face-up) during sleep. A special pillow or similar bed device can help you stay sleeping on your side where gravity does not cause your tongue or throat to block your airway. Before purchasing a device, some people try “homemade” positional methods such as a special pillow or bumpers for the bed.\nPosition Monitoring Device/Stimulation\nA positional monitoring device can treat mild to moderate OSA caused by sleeping on your back. It is worn on the body (usually around the neck or chest) and monitors your sleeping position with a device called a position accelerometer. When you are lying on your back, or face-up, during sleep, the device vibrates with increasing intensity until you turn over to sleep on your side.\nMedicines May Not Mix With OSA\nThere are no FDA-approved drugs to treat sleep apnea. Elisabeth Boulos, M.D., at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, says that doctors sometimes prescribe medicines that help keep you awake if you have OSA and persistent daytime sleepiness despite treatment with a CPAP machine. These medicines may help manage some symptoms but do not fix the nighttime breathing problem.\nMoreover, Dr. Boulos recommends that if you've been diagnosed with sleep apnea and are taking other medicines, you should let your doctor know what those medicines are. \"A number of prescription drugs—in addition to alcohol and tobacco products—can actually make sleep apnea worse, including many for insomnia, anxiety or severe pain,\" she says."

Not lately?\nIf you’re lying awake night after night, unable to sleep, you may want to talk to your health care professional about it. They may prescribe insomnia medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, such as eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata) and zolpidem (Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar, and Zolpimist). Sometimes known as “Z-drugs,” they might help you get a good night’s sleep. But as with any medicine, there are risks.\nPrescription Z-drugs work by slowing activity in the brain. Used properly, they can help you sleep. Quality sleep can have a positive impact on physical and mental health. But the treatments also carry the risk – though rare – of serious injuries, and even death. Be aware of these risks.\nIn 2019, the FDA required the addition of the risks for complex sleep behaviors resulting in serious injuries or death to the labeling and Patient Medication Guides for all prescription Z-drugs.\nWhat Are Complex Sleep Behaviors?\nComplex sleep behaviors occur while you are not fully awake. Examples include sleepwalking, sleep driving, sleep cooking, or taking other medicines.\nThe FDA has received reports of people taking these insomnia medicines and accidentally overdosing, falling, being burned, shooting themselves, and wandering outside in extremely cold weather, among other incidents.\nPeople might not remember these behaviors when they wake up the next morning. Moreover, they may experience these types of behaviors after their first dose of one of these Z-drugs, or after continued use.\nTips for Taking Medicines for Insomnia\nIf your health care professional prescribes a Z-drug to help you sleep, discuss with them the benefits and risks.\nBe sure to read the Patient Medication Guide as soon as you get the prescription filled and before you start taking the medicine. If you have any questions or don’t understand something, ask your health care professional.\nAfter taking the medicine, if you experience a complex sleep behavior, stop taking the drug and contact your health care professional immediately.\nComplex sleep behaviors can occur at lower dosages, not just high doses. It’s important to carefully follow the dosing instructions as directed by your health care professional.\nDon’t take these medicines with any other sleep drugs, including those you can buy over-the-counter without a prescription.\nDon’t drink alcohol before or while taking these medicines; together they may be more likely to cause side effects.\nYou may still feel drowsy the day after taking one of these drugs. Keep in mind that all insomnia medicines can impair your ability to drive and activities that require alertness the morning after use.\nFor information on healthy sleep habits, visit Tips for Better Sleep and Insomnia: Relaxation techniques and sleeping habits."

Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg fails to reach the womb, but instead begins to grow outside of the womb. This serious condition almost always results in death of the unborn child, and in some cases, death of the mother as well.\nAdditionally, there is some evidence that smoking during pregnancy may result in miscarriage of the fetus or unborn baby.2\nNo tobacco product is safe to use during pregnancy. Nearly all tobacco products—including most e-cigarettes—contain nicotine, which can cross the placenta and interfere with fetal and postnatal development.5\nIf you’re pregnant and interested in quitting smoking, consult with your health care provider to talk about your reproductive health. You can also get free resources for quitting while pregnant, including a texting program to offer support for pregnant people trying to quit.\n\nCan Smoking Put Me at Risk for Cervical Cancer? \nYes, smoking cigarettes can cause cervical cancer.1 This type of cancer occurs in the cervix, the lower, narrow end of the uterus that forms a canal between the uterus and vagina.\nWithin just a few years of quitting smoking, risk of cervical cancer is reduced.1 If you use tobacco and want to quit, there are resources that can help you quit smoking. \n\nCan Smoking Put Me at Risk for Erectile Dysfunction?\nYes, smoking can increase your risk for erectile dysfunction,3 a condition in which you are unable to get or keep an erection firm enough for satisfactory sexual intercourse.  \n\nCan Smoking Increase My Likelihood of Dying From Prostate Cancer? \nYes, smoking can increase your likelihood of dying from prostate cancer.3 The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system and produces a fluid that forms part of the semen. Prostate cancer begins in the prostate.\nIf you have prostate cancer and smoke, you may be more likely to die from the disease than those with prostate cancer who don’t smoke.3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS).

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEspañol\nTattoos are more popular than ever. About 30% of all Americans, and 40% of those aged 18-34 years old, have at least one tattoo, according to polling by the firm Ipsos.\nWhile state and local authorities oversee the practice of tattooing, inks and pigments used in tattoos are subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversight as cosmetics. The FDA takes action to protect consumers when safety issues arise related to the inks.\nOver the years, the FDA has received reports of people developing infections from contaminated tattoo inks, as well as allergic reactions to the inks themselves. In 2019, the FDA issued a safety alert about certain tattoo inks contaminated with microorganisms. In June 2023, the FDA issued a draft guidance to help tattoo ink manufacturers and distributors recognize situations in which tattoo ink may become contaminated with microorganisms, such as bacteria or mold. The draft guidance also recommends certain steps manufacturers and distributors can take to help prevent it.\nQuestions to Consider Before Getting a Permanent Tattoo or Permanent Makeup\nA tattoo is permanent when a needle inserts colored ink into skin. Permanent makeup is a type of tattoo applied to look like makeup, such as eyeliner, lip liner, or eyebrows.\nPermanent tattoos are designed to last a lifetime and are difficult to remove. With that in mind, consider these key questions, answered below by Linda Katz, M.D., M.P.H., director of FDA’s Office of Cosmetics and Colors. For information on temporary tattoos, please visit, “Temporary Tattoos, Henna/Mehndi, and \"Black Henna\": Fact Sheet”\nShould I have any concerns about the tattoo ink itself?\nWhile you can get serious infections from unhygienic practices and equipment that isn’t sterile, infections can also result from ink that was contaminated with bacteria, mold, or other microorganisms. Using non-sterile water to dilute the pigments (ingredients that add color) is a common culprit, although not the only one.\nThere’s no sure-fire way to tell if the ink is safe without testing. An ink can be contaminated even if the container is sealed, or the label says the product is sterile.\nWhat is in tattoo ink?\nTattoo inks are colored liquid mixtures used to create body art. The inks contain pigments that are mixed with water and may contain a variety of other components, depending on the ink.\nPublished research has reported that some inks contain pigments used in printer toner or in car paint. The FDA has not approved any pigments for injection into the skin for cosmetic purposes.\nWhat kinds of reactions may happen after getting a tattoo?\nFollowing a tattoo you may notice some redness, swelling, or warmth of the skin. Your tattooist should advise you how to care for a newly tattooed area and how long you may experience some local discomfort.\nIf you notice that the area seems not to be healing or if you notice a rash — redness or bumps — near your tattoo, contact the tattooist and your health care professional especially if you develop a fever.\nMore aggressive infections may cause high fever, shaking, chills, and sweats. Treating such infections might require a variety of antibiotics — possibly for months — or even hospitalization and/or surgery. A rash may also mean you’re having an allergic reaction. And because the inks are permanent, the reaction may persist.\nContact your health care professional if you have any concerns. The FDA reviews reports of adverse reactions or infections from consumers, health care professionals, and industry. We may also learn about outbreaks from state authorities who oversee tattoo parlors.\n\nThis is an example of an allergic reaction to a tattoo.\nCan scar tissue build up after getting a tattoo?\nScar tissue may form when you get a tattoo, or you could develop “granulomas,” small knots or bumps that may form around material that the body perceives as foreign. If you tend to get keloids — scars that grow beyond normal boundaries — you may develop the same kind of reaction to the tattoo.\nWhat do I need to know about MRIs if I get a tattoo?\nSome people may have swelling or burning in the tattoo when they have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although this happens rarely and does not last long. Let your health care professional know that you have a tattoo before having this type of medical imaging.\nWhat about do-it-yourself tattoo inks and kits?\nInks and kits sold as “do-it-yourself” to consumers have been associated with infections and allergic reactions. The FDA is also concerned that consumers may not know how to control and avoid all sources of contamination.\nCould other problems occur later?\nAlthough research is ongoing at the FDA and elsewhere, there are still a lot of questions about the long-term effects that may be caused by the pigments, other ingredients, and possible contaminants in tattoo inks. The FDA has received reports of bad reactions to tattoo inks right after tattooing and even years later. You also might become allergic to other products, such as hair dyes, if your tattoo contains p-phenylenediamene (PPD).\nThen there’s tattoo removal. We don’t know the short- or long-term consequences of how pigments break down after laser treatment. However, we do know some tattoo removal procedures may leave permanent scarring and may fail to remove the tattoo completely.\nIf I get a tattoo and develop an infection or other reaction, what should I do?\nContact your health care professional.\nNotify the tattoo artist so they can identify the ink and avoid using it again. Ask for the brand, color, and any lot or batch number of the ink or diluent to help determine the source of the problem and how to treat it.\nWhether you’re a consumer, tattoo artist, or health care professional, tell the FDA. Provide as much detail as possible about the ink and your reaction and outcome. Reports from consumers are one of our most important sources of safety information.\nAdditional Resources:\n\nTattoos & Permanent Makeup: Fact Sheet\nTemporary Tattoos, Henna/Mehndi, and \"Black Henna\": Fact Sheet\nCosmetic Safety Q&A: Tattoos and Permanent Makeup\nMicrobiological Survey of 47 Permanent Makeup Inks Available in the United States\nMicrobiological survey of commercial tattoo and permanent makeup inks available in the United States \nDraft Guidance for Industry: Insanitary Conditions in the Preparation, Packing, and Holding of Tattoo Inks and the Risk of Microbial Contamination"

Here is information about the safety of these products and how they are regulated.\n\n\"Decal\" Temporary Tattoos\nHenna, or Mehndi, and \"Black Henna\"\nFinding out What's in a Temporary Tattoo or Henna/Mehndi Product\nFDA's Authority over Color Additives in Cosmetics\nFDA's Authority over Other Cosmetic Ingredients\nFDA Enforcement Action\nHow to Report a Reaction to a Temporary Tattoo or Other Cosmetic\nMore Resources on Temporary Tattoos:\nRelated Resources:\n\n\"Decal\" Temporary Tattoos\nDecal temporary tattoos are used to decorate any part of the body, including areas of the face and around the eyes, and may last for a day or up to a week or more. They are especially popular with children and at Halloween. \nThere are two kinds of decal tattoos:\n\nSome are images attached to a removable backing. The decal image is removed from the backing by wetting, and the image is then applied directly to the skin.\nOthers have a backing that adheres to the skin, creating a partial or complete barrier between the skin and the dyes used in the image.\n\nThe difference is important, because not all dyes are known to be safe for use on the skin. While an adhesive backing may protect the skin from unapproved colors, there may be other ingredients on or in the decal to help the image adhere better either to the backing or to the skin that may cause problems for some people. \nFDA has received reports of reactions to some decal-type temporary tattoos. Before using a temporary tattoo on your face, it may be a good idea to try it on a less conspicuous part of your body.\nHenna, or Mehndi, and \"Black Henna\"\nHenna, a coloring made from a plant, is approved only for use as a hair dye. It is not approved for direct application to the skin, as in the body-decorating process known as mehndi. This unapproved use of a color additive makes these products adulterated. It is unlawful, for example, to introduce an adulterated cosmetic into interstate commerce.\nBecause henna typically produces a brown, orange-brown, or reddish-brown tint, other ingredients must be added to produce other colors, such as those marketed as \"black henna\" and \"blue henna.\" Even brown shades of products marketed as henna may contain other ingredients intended to make them darker or make the stain last longer on the skin.\nThe extra ingredient used to blacken henna is often a coal-tar hair dye containing p-phenylenediamine (PPD), an ingredient that can cause dangerous skin reactions in some people. That's the reason hair dyes have a caution statement and instructions to do a \"patch test\" on a small area of the skin before using them. Sometimes, the artist may use a PPD-containing hair dye alone. Either way, there's no telling who will be affected. By law, PPD is not permitted in cosmetics intended to be applied to the skin.\nFDA has received reports of injuries to the skin from products marketed as henna and products marketed as \"black henna.\" For more information on Henna, see the consumer update: Temporary Tattoos May Put You at Risk.\n\nAllergic reaction on a man's hand.

Marazzi/Photo Researchers.\nFinding out What's in a Temporary Tattoo or Henna/Mehndi Product\nCosmetics that are sold on a retail basis to consumers must have their ingredients listed on the label. Without such an ingredient declaration, they are considered misbranded, and therefore it is unlawful to introduce them into interstate commerce. FDA requires the ingredient declaration under the authority of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA).\nBecause the FPLA does not apply to cosmetic samples and products used only by professionals--for example, for application at a salon, or a booth at a fair or boardwalk--the requirement for an ingredient declaration does not apply to these products.\nFDA's Authority over Color Additives in Cosmetics\nBy law, all color additives used in cosmetics must be approved by FDA for their intended uses, with the exception of coal tar colors intended for use in hair dyes. In addition, some color additives must not be used unless FDA has certified that the batch meets the regulatory requirements for composition and purity. Cosmetics, including temporary tattoo products, that do not comply with restrictions on color additives are considered adulterated, and it is unlawful to introduce them into interstate commerce. To learn more, see Color Additives and Cosmetics, and, for information on how color additives are approved, Color Additive Petitions.\nFDA's Authority over Other Cosmetic Ingredients\nCosmetics must be safe when consumers use them following directions on the label, or in the customary or expected way. Except for color additives, the law does not require cosmetic products and ingredients to have FDA approval before they are marketed.  In addition, firms are not required to report their safety information, including complaints.\nFor a list of ingredients that are prohibited or restricted in cosmetics, see “Prohibited and Restricted Ingredients.” \nFor a list of color additives allowed in cosmetics, how they are allowed to be used, and links to their regulations, see “Color Additives Permitted for Use in Cosmetics.”\nFDA Enforcement Action\nFDA can take action against cosmetics on the market that don’t comply with the law. For example, we can issue Import Alerts and Warning Letters.\nAn Import Alert allows FDA to detain products that violate or appear to violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We have two Import Alerts in effect for temporary tattoos. However, because not all shipments of imported cosmetics are inspected, it’s still possible for some unsafe or mislabeled products to be imported into this country.\n\nAn Import Alert is in effect for several foreign-made decal temporary tattoos because they contain colors not permitted for use in cosmetics applied to the skin, or they don't have the required ingredient list on the label, or they are labeled as “FDA approved.”\nAn Import Alert is in effect for henna intended for use on the skin because it is an unapproved use of the color additive.\n\nFDA issues Warning Letters to let companies know that they have violated the law and to tell them what corrective action they need to take. We have issued a Warning Letter to a company marketing “black henna” products:\n\nWarning Letters to Industry on Cosmetic-Related Issues\n\nIt is important to note that the practice of tattooing is generally regulated by state and/or local officials, and that the FDA is not typically involved in such enforcement. While states have jurisdiction over professional practices such as tattooing and cosmetology, that oversight differs from state to state. Some states have laws and regulations for temporary tattooing, while others don't. So, depending on where you are, it's possible no one is checking to make sure the artist is following safe practices or even knows what may be harmful to consumers.\nHow to Report a Reaction to a Temporary Tattoo or Other Cosmetic Products\nIt’s important for consumers and health care professionals to report problems with cosmetic products to FDA. This information helps FDA find out which products are causing problems, and what kinds of problems.\nYou can report a problem with a cosmetic product to FDA by using the contact information at How to Report a Cosmetic Product Related Complaint | FDA.\nRelated Resources\n\nConsumer Update: Temporary Tattoos May Put You at Risk\nTemporary Tattoos: Raising Consumer Awareness of Safety: FDA Webinar, May 13, 2014\nWarning Letter Issued to Black Henna Ink, Inc.\nImport Alert #53-19: Detention Without Physical Examination of Henna Based Skin Color\nLucky 13 Tips for a Safe Halloween\nNovelty Makeup: Special for Halloween\nTattoos and Permanent Makeup\nFDA Authority Over Cosmetics\nFDA Recall Policy for Cosmetics\nTattoos & Permanent Makeup: Quick Guide (PDF: 536 KB)\nLos Tatuajes y el Maquillaje Permanente: Una Guía (PDF: 522KB)"

        "content": "Tattoos are used for various reasons including beauty, self-expression, and after certain reconstructive surgeries to simulate skin pigmentation. A tattoo is permanent when a needle inserts colored ink into skin.\nCommon types of tattoos include:\n\nbody art\npermanent makeup\nmicroblading inks\ntemporary tattoos, henna/mehndi, and \"black henna\"\n\n\n\nInks used in intradermal tattoos, including permanent makeup, fall within the definition of cosmetics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The actual practice of tattooing, including tattoo parlor practices and safety, is generally regulated by local jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nTattoos and Permanent Makeup\nBecause tattoos are permanent, they last a lifetime. Permanent makeup is a type of tattoo. A needle inserts colored ink into your skin to look like eyeliner, lip liner, eyebrows, or other makeup.\nThere are a variety of pigments and diluents being used in tattooing. More than 50 different pigments and shades are in use, and the list continues to grow. Although a number of color additives are approved for use in cosmetics, none are approved for injection into the skin. Using an unapproved color additive in a tattoo ink makes the ink adulterated. Many pigments used in tattoo inks are not approved for skin contact. Some are industrial grade colors that are suitable for printers' ink or automobile paint.\n\nTattoos & Permanent Makeup: Quick Guide (PDF: 536 KB)\nLos Tatuajes y el Maquillaje Permanente: Una Guía (PDF: 522KB)\n\nHealth Risks\nTattoos can cause adverse effects, and some can be irreversible.\nSome risks include:\n\nInfections\nAllergic reactions\nGranulomas\nKeloid formation\nIncreased chance of sunburn, redness, or scarring\nSwelling and burning\nMRI complications\nRemoval problems\n\nWhen the FDA identifies a safety problem associated with a cosmetic, including a tattoo ink, the agency investigates and takes action, as appropriate, to prevent consumer illness or injury.\nWhat Can Industry Do to Help Product Consumers?\nUnlike most cosmetics, tattoo inks are injected into the dermal layer of the skin and present a unique challenge as they could potentially introduce harmful pathogens directly into the body. Because of this unique challenge, it is important for tattoo inks to be manufactured using methods to ensure a product is free of all forms of viable microorganisms.\nOn June 12, 2023, the FDA issued “Insanitary Conditions at Tattoo Ink Manufacturing and Distribution Facilities; Draft Guidance for Industry” to help tattoo ink manufacturers and distributors recognize situations in which a tattoo ink may become contaminated with microorganisms, and thus, be potentially injurious to health. This guidance also recommends certain steps that manufacturers and distributors could take to help prevent the occurrence of these conditions, or to identify and remediate insanitary conditions that already exist during manufacturing and distribution.\nAdditionally, manufacturer testing of the final formulated tattoo ink products to ensure the inks are free of any microorganisms can help protect consumer safety. For more information on testing methods, please see Microbiological Methods for Testing the Sterility of Tattoo Inks and Method for Isolation and Detection of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria in Tattoo Inks.\nThe tattoo manufacturer and distributor are responsible for the safety of the products that they sell to retailers.\nSafety Alerts, Recalls and Warning Letters\nThe FDA monitors the safety of tattoos and permanent make-up and alerts the public when the agency becomes aware of any issues associated with inks.\nSafety Alerts/Recalls\n\nIn May 2019, the FDA warned consumers against certain contaminated tattoo inks.\nIn the fall of 2017, a firm voluntarily recalled several colors and sizes of tattoo inks, due to microbial contamination identified by an FDA survey.\nIn the summer of 2014, the FDA notified consumers of the  voluntary recall of tattoo inks and needles due to confirmed bacterial contamination.\nIn the spring of 2012, the FDA received reports of infections from contaminated inks, resulting in their recall and market withdrawal.\nIn the fall of 2011, a firm initiated a recall for its product due to lab test results finding traces of bacteria in the ink.\nAdditionally, in 2003 and 2004, the FDA became aware of more than 150 reports of adverse reactions in consumers to certain permanent makeup ink shades. The inks associated with this outbreak were voluntarily recalled by the company that marketed them in 2004.\n\nWarning Letters\n\nColor Art, Inc. DBA Solid Ink\nDynamic Color Inc\nIntenze Products Inc.\nBlack Henna Ink, Inc.\n\nOther Actions\n\nThe FDA has also established Import Alert #53-19: Detention Without Physical Examination of Henna Based Skin Color.\n\nReporting Adverse Reactions\nThe FDA urges consumers and healthcare professionals to report adverse reactions from tattoos, permanent makeup, and temporary tattoos, as well as problems with tattoo removal.\nConsumers and healthcare professionals can report problems to FDA by using the contact information at How to Report a Cosmetic Related Complaint | FDA.\nThe FDA continues to evaluate the extent and severity of adverse events associated with tattooing and is conducting research on tattoo inks.

        "content": "Image\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEspañol\nSometimes people get a permanent tattoo then later decide they no longer want it. Life situations change or maybe the tattoo just didn’t come out as hoped. Removing a tattoo isn’t as easy as it might seem. It can be painful, and risks include possible scarring and infection. When done by a trained health care professional, laser tattoo removal can be safe and effective. Want to remove a tattoo? Talk with a health care professional about the laser procedure, expectations, benefits, and risks.\nWhile state and local authorities oversee the practice of tattooing, the inks and pigments used in tattoos are subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversight as cosmetics. The FDA takes action to protect consumers when safety issues arise related to the inks.\nAt the other end of the tattoo process, the FDA also regulates laser devices used to remove tattoos. The FDA has cleared for marketing several types of lasers for tattoo lightening or removal. The lasers are cleared for use by, or under the supervision of, a health care professional. Laser tattoo removal requires using the correct type of laser, understanding the reaction of tissue to laser, and knowing how to treat the area after the procedure.\nLaser Tattoo Removal\nTattoos that are applied with a needle are meant to be permanent.\nArtists create tattoos by using an electrically powered machine that moves a needle up and down to inject ink into the skin, penetrating the epidermis, or outer layer, and depositing a drop of ink into the dermis, the second layer of skin. The cells of the dermis are more stable compared with those of the epidermis, so the ink will mostly stay in place for a person’s lifetime.\nPermanent makeup also is a type of tattoo that is applied to look like eyebrows or eyeliner or lip liner, for example.\n\nLaser tattoo removal is the most common method health care professionals use to remove or lighten tattoos. The laser light energy shatters the tattoo ink into small particles, which the body’s immune system clears over time.\n\nThe type of laser used to remove a tattoo depends on the tattoo’s colors. Because different colors of ink absorb different wavelengths of light, multi-colored tattoos may require the use of multiple lasers. Colors such as green, red, and yellow are the hardest colors to remove, while dark blue and black are the easiest. Flesh-colored tattoos, white ink, and permanent makeup are particularly tricky, because the pigment in these colors can oxidize (turn black) when treated by laser. Oxidized pigment is no longer treatable by laser.\nLaser tattoo removal requires multiple treatments with a few weeks in between procedures to give the skin time to heal. The length and number of treatments depends on several factors, including the size of the tattoo and the colors used. Complete removal of the tattoo can take many treatments, and in some cases may not be possible.\nPain and Side Effects of Laser Tattoo Removal\nDoes tattoo removal hurt? Laser tattoo removal is like snapping a thin rubber band against the skin. If it is painful, a small amount of numbing cream can be applied to the skin before the procedure.\nLaser tattoo removal can leave behind skin that is lighter than the skin around it. Other risks include possible scarring, infection, pinpoint bleeding, redness, or soreness, none of which should last for long.\nOther Methods of Tattoo Removal\nBesides laser, there are other, less commonly used ways to lighten tattoos. They include:\n\nDermabrasion (“sanding” away the top layer of skin using a motorized wire brush or abrader).\nAblative (non-tattoo) lasers that burn off the entire top layer of skin.\nSurgical removal of the tattooed skin.\n\nTechnically, these methods do not remove the pigment. Instead, they wound the skin above and around the pigment to stimulate an immune response that may lighten the pigment as the skin heals. The results are highly variable. At best, the pigment may be lightened, but there is greater potential for scarring and undesirable cosmetic effects. In general, the use of these methods is not optimal and less common for these reasons.\nA Note About Creams\nThe FDA has not approved tattoo removal ointments and creams or do-it-yourself tattoo removal kits. The ingredients in these creams may include retinol, bleaching creams, and peeling agents that superficially exfoliate the skin, but they cannot reach tattoo pigment that is in the deeper dermis. The FDA has not reviewed these products and is not aware of any evidence that they are safe or effective for tattoo removal. These products may cause skin rashes, burns, or scars.\nReporting Problems with Tattoos and Tattoo Removal\nIf you have had an adverse (negative) reaction from tattoos, or problems with tattoo removal, you can voluntarily report them to MedWatch, the FDA’s safety information and adverse event reporting program.\nAdditional Resources\n\nThink Before You Ink: Tattoo Safety, FDA Consumer Update\nTattoos & Permanent Makeup: Fact Sheet, FDA webpage\nTemporary Tattoos, Henna/Mehndi, and \"Black Henna\": Fact Sheet, FDA webpage\nLaser Products and Instruments, FDA webpage\nMedical Lasers, FDA webpage"

Crecen dentro y alrededor de la pared muscular del útero (matriz). Pueden crecer como un solo tumor o puede haber muchos. Pueden ser tan pequeños como una semilla de manzana o tan grandes como una toronja. Los fibromas pueden crecer o permanecer del mismo tamaño. Otro término médico para los fibromas es leiomioma o simplemente \"mioma\".\nDescargue la hoja informativa sobre los fibromas uterinos\n¿Cuáles son los síntomas de los fibromas? \n¿Qué causa los fibromas? \n¿Cómo puedo saber si tengo fibromas? \n¿Cómo se tratan los fibromas?\n¿Cuáles son los síntomas de los fibromas?\nLos fibromas no siempre causan síntomas. Las personas que tienen síntomas pueden sentir que los fibromas son difíciles de tolerar. Los síntomas de los fibromas pueden incluir cambios en la menstruación (su periodo), sangrado abundante, sangrado vaginal entre los periodos, periodos dolorosos, anemia (bajo recuento de glóbulos rojos, resultante de un sangrado excesivo), sensación de \"llenura\" o presión en la parte inferior del abdomen, micción frecuente, dolor el vientre o la parte baja de la espalda, y dolor durante las relaciones sexuales. Los fibromas pueden causar otros problemas reproductivos, como la infertilidad, los abortos espontáneos y los problemas obstétricos como un parto prematuro y/o una mayor probabilidad de cesárea.\n¿Qué causa los fibromas?\nNo se sabe con certeza cuál es la causa de los fibromas. Los investigadores creen que hay más de un factor que podría influir. Entre estos factores se encuentran la edad, tener un familiar con fibromas, la raza/origen étnico, el sobrepeso o la obesidad, la hipertensión arterial y/o determinados factores dietéticos y/u hormonales.\n¿Cómo puedo saber si tengo fibromas?\nA menos que tenga síntomas, es posible que no sepa si tiene fibromas. En algunos casos, un proveedor de atención médica puede detectar los fibromas durante un examen pélvico rutinario. Su proveedor también puede solicitar imágenes médicas (en inglés) como una ecografía pélvica para ver una imagen de los fibromas. Las pruebas de imagen pueden incluir: \n\nUltrasonido: utiliza ondas sonoras para obtener una imagen; la sonda de ultrasonido puede colocarse sobre el abdomen (vientre) o dentro de la vagina\nSonohisterografía de infusión salina (SIS o SHG, por sus siglas en inglés) o ultrasonido salino: utiliza una pequeña cantidad de solución salina colocada dentro del útero (matriz) para ayudar a \"ver\" el interior del útero en una ecografía \nResonancia magnética (RM): utiliza imanes y ondas de radio para obtener una imagen del interior del cuerpo\nTomografía computarizada (TC) o tomografía asistida por ordenador (TAC): escanea el cuerpo con rayos X desde muchos ángulos para formar una imagen más completa que una radiografía simple \n\nOtras pruebas que su proveedor de atención médica puede solicitar son:\n\nRecuento sanguíneo completo (CBC, por sus siglas en inglés): análisis de sangre para comprobar si hay señales de anemia (recuento bajo de glóbulos rojos)\nNiveles de hierro en sangre: análisis de sangre para medir los niveles de hierro y confirmar si existe anemia por deficiencia de hierro (anemia ferropénica)\n\nLa cirugía (es decir, la histeroscopia) puede confirmar el diagnóstico ecográfico de los fibromas y proporcionar información adicional como la localización de los mismos.\n¿Cómo se tratan los fibromas?\nSi tiene fibromas, pero no tiene síntomas, es posible que no necesite una intervención médica. Si tiene síntomas, hay tratamientos médicos que pueden ayudar. Hable con su proveedor de atención médica sobre la mejor manera de tratar sus fibromas. Su proveedor puede comprobar durante los exámenes regulares y con imágenes si sus fibromas han crecido. \nPóngase en contacto con su proveedor de atención médica si tiene alguno de los siguientes síntomas:Sangrado abundante o entre los períodos\n\nCalambres o dolores fuertes con la menstruación\nUna sensación de \"llenura\" o pesadez en el vientre o cerca de él\nMicción frecuente o dificultad para orinar\n\nSi tiene síntomas moderados o graves causado por fibromas, su proveedor puede recomendar un tratamiento médico, una cirugía u otros procedimientos de intervención en función de sus síntomas y su historial. Los tratamientos médicos incluyen tratamientos médicos hormonales como las píldoras anticonceptivas, los anillos anticonceptivos vaginales o los dispositivos intrauterinos con hormonas, que pueden ayudar a controlar el sangrado menstrual abundante asociado con los fibromas. Se han aprobado nuevos medicamentos para controlar el sangrado menstrual abundante asociado con los fibromas en las mujeres premenopáusicas. Las opciones quirúrgicas incluyen la extirpación de los fibromas (miomectomía), la destrucción de los fibromas sin extirparlos o la extirpación del útero (histerectomía). Estos procedimientos pueden realizarse utilizando diferentes métodos, desde procedimientos mínimamente invasivos hasta la cirugía vaginal o abdominal abierta. El tipo de cirugía/procedimiento dependerá del número de fibromas presentes, de la localización de los mismos y de si se desea tener hijos en el futuro. \nHable con su proveedor sobre todas las opciones de tratamiento médico, sus riesgos y beneficios. Su proveedor puede responder a todas sus preguntas y juntos pueden decidir qué tratamiento es el adecuado para usted.\nCampaña de diversidad de mujeres en los estudios clínicos\nLos estudios clínicos pueden ayudar a los médicos a aprender más sobre los tratamientos seguros para los fibromas. La Oficina de Salud de la Mujer de la FDA se ha asociado con la Oficina de Investigación sobre la Salud de la Mujer de los Institutos Nacionales de la Salud (NIH, por sus siglas en inglés) para crear conciencia sobre la participación de mujeres de diferentes edades, razas, orígenes étnicos y condiciones de salud en los estudios clínicos.\nVisite la página web Las Mujeres en los Estudios Clínicos para obtener más información sobre cómo participar en un estudio clínico y encuentre un estudio aquí (en inglés).\nPara obtener recursos y materiales sobre otros temas relacionados con la salud de la mujer, visite www.fda.gov/womens (en inglés).\nPara Aprender Más Sobre los Fibromas Uterinos  \n\nDescargue la hoja informativa sobre los fibromas uterinos en español \nDescargue la Tarjeta de consejos sobre los fibromas uterinos: Consejos para mujeres jóvenes\nDescargue otras publicaciones sobre la salud de la mujer en español\nLa FDA aprueba una nueva opción para tratar el sangrado menstrual abundante asociado con fibromas en las mujeres\n\nRecursos Adicionales: Otros Recursos Federales\n\nFibroides uterinos - MedlinePlus\nFibromas uterinos - NIH-NICHD\nFibromas uterinos - HHS OWH"

I have been happily married to my husband Tim for over eighteen years. I am a mommy to two miracle daughters after going through eight years of infertility, eight years of secondary infertility, three laparoscopic surgeries, a failed IVF transfer and a robotic laparoscopic myomectomy. I am a survivor, writer, public speaker, model and women’s advocate. \nCan you tell us about, briefly summarize, your fibroid journey?\nIn my early 20’s, I was diagnosed with three small fibroids, but I was told to not worry about them. My doctor said to concentrate on the other issues I was having at the time. I suffered with horrible periods since the age of 10 and I often felt I should keep quiet about my concerns. I completely forgot about the fibroids as time went on and while trying to conceive. In October of 2020, I requested a consultation because of the horrible pain I was having. After an ultrasound and an MRI, I was notified that my fibroids had grown. My options were to have a hysterectomy or a robotic laparoscopic myomectomy. I proceeded with the robotic laparoscopic myomectomy in February 2021, became pregnant in August, and gave birth to my second miracle daughter earlier this year. \nWhat do you wish you knew earlier in your fibroid journey?\nI wish I knew of the many options to help treat fibroids as it can be debilitating disease. For years, I believed my only option was to have a hysterectomy. I am so glad that my new doctor explained my options clearly which gave me the opportunity to make a choice.\nWhere are you now in your fibroid journey? \nI am so happy, fearless, healthy and continuing to raise awareness these days. I have embraced my journey and everything that makes me who I am. I have overcome so much, and I have learned to love every part of my story. I realize that fibroids do not define who I am. It is my purpose to instill hope in those who are still suffering in silence. \nHow have you adjusted to being a mom of two post fibroids? \nI have adjusted really well. In my 20’s I hated my body and I felt that my life wasn’t worth saving. Today, at 40, I am stronger, wiser, compassionate and I have healed both physically and spiritually. I love being a mom and I often reflect on what it took to become a mother. I also continue to think about all the women who continue to struggle with fibroids and infertility issues. My heart is with them, and I believe we are all in this fight together.\n\nWatch La-Anna's story below to learn more about how she has navigated living with fibroids and her journey to embracing her new life.\n\n\n\nLearn more about Uterine Fibroids at the following resources\n\nUterine Fibroids\nDownload Uterine Fibroids Factsheet\nDownload Uterine Fibroids Tip Card: Tips for Young Women \nFDA’s Approves New Option to Treat Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Fibroids in Women\nFDA Takes New Steps to Increase the Safety of Laparoscopic Power Morcellators when used in Gynecologic Surgeries \nLearn more about laparoscopic power morcellators  \nThe FDA recommends performing contained morcellation in women when laparoscopic power morcellation is appropriate\nWhite Dress Project\nHHS Office of Women's Health: Uterine Fibroids \nNIH NICHD: Uterine Fibroids \nMedline Plus: Uterine Fibroids \n\nFor resources and materials on other women's health topics, visit www.fda.gov/womens."

        "content": "For Immediate Release:\nMay 29, 2020\n\n\n\nEspañol\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration today granted approval to Oriahnn (an estrogen and progestin combination product consisting of elagolix, estradiol and norethindrone acetate) capsules, co-packaged for oral use, for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) in premenopausal women.\n“Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors affecting premenopausal women, and one of the most common symptoms from fibroids is heavy menstrual bleeding,” said Christine P. Nguyen, MD, Acting Director, Division of Urology, Obstetrics and Gynecology in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Although surgical treatments, such as hysterectomy, are available, patients may not qualify for surgery or want the procedure. Various non-surgical therapies are used to treat fibroid-related heavy menstrual bleeding, but none have been FDA-approved specifically for this use. Today’s approval provides an FDA-approved medical treatment option for these patients.”\nFibroids are benign (non-cancerous) muscle tumors of the uterus that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, bowel or bladder problems and infertility. Some women may not experience any symptoms, but many do, including heavy bleeding with periods. Fibroids can occur at any age but are most common in women 35 to 49 years of age. They typically resolve after menopause but are a leading reason for hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) in the United States when they cause severe symptoms.\nThe efficacy of Oriahnn was established in two clinical trials in which a total of 591 premenopausal women with heavy menstrual bleeding received the drug or placebo for six months. Heavy menstrual bleeding at baseline was defined as having at least two menstrual cycles with greater than 80 mL (about a third of a cup) of menstrual blood loss (MBL). The primary endpoint was the proportion of women who achieved MBL volume less than 80 mL at the final month and 50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from the start of the study (baseline) to the final month. In the first study, 68.5% of patients who received Oriahnn achieved this endpoint (compared to 8.7% of patients who received placebo). In the second study, 76.5% of patients who received Oriahnn achieved this endpoint (compared to 10.5% of patients who received placebo).\nOriahnn may cause bone loss over time, and the loss in some women may not be completely recovered after stopping treatment. Because bone loss may increase the risk for fractures, women should not take Oriahnn for more than 24 months. Health care professionals may recommend a bone density scan (called DXA scan) when starting women on Oriahnn and periodically while on treatment.\nThe most common side effects of Oriahnn were hot flushes (sudden feelings of warmth), headache, fatigue and irregular vaginal bleeding. The drug label for Oriahnn includes a Boxed Warning about the risk of vascular events (strokes) and thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders (blood clots), especially in women at increased risk for these events. Patients should stop Oriahnn if a blood clot, heart attack or stroke occurs. Oriahnn is contraindicated (not to be used under any circumstance) in women with a history of or current blood clots and in women at increased risk for blood clots, including women over 35 years of age who smoke or women with uncontrolled hypertension (high blood pressure). Other contraindications include known osteoporosis, a history of or current breast cancer or other hormonally-sensitive cancer, liver disease or undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding.\nOriahnn does not prevent pregnancy. Women should use non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for one week after discontinuing the medication. Oriahnn may delay the detection of a pregnancy because it changes menstrual bleeding patterns. Oriahnn may increase blood pressure, which should be monitored in women with controlled hypertension during treatment with Oriahnn. Patients should be advised on signs and symptoms of liver injury. Patients are advised to seek medical attention if they experience suicidal ideation or behavior, new onset or worsening depression, anxiety or other mood changes. Patients taking Oriahnn may experience hair loss (alopecia). There is a risk of allergic reaction with Oriahnn because its inactive ingredient, FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in some women.\nOriahnn must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide that describes important information about the drug’s uses and risks.\nThe approval of Oriahnn was granted to AbbVie Inc.\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

        "content": "For Immediate Release:\nFebruary 25, 2020\n\nStatement From:\n\n                                \n                                    \n            Jeff  Shuren, M.D., J.D.            \nDirector - CDRH Offices:  Office of the Center Director\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, we are taking several important steps to make the use of laparoscopic power morcellators (LPMs) safer in gynecologic surgeries, including granting marketing authorization for updated labeling of the PneumoLiner containment system (a device that contains tissue to be morcellated during certain gynecologic surgeries), releasing a draft guidance recommending the addition of specific safety information to the product labeling for LPMs, and issuing a Safety Communication recommending that an LPM only be used in certain gynecologic surgeries with a containment system that is compatible with the LPM.\nLPMs are used during laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgeries to cut tissue into smaller pieces so the tissue can be removed through a small incision site. These devices can be used in a variety of surgeries, including various gynecologic surgeries such as a myomectomy, a surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids from a woman’s uterus. While laparoscopic surgeries are associated with shorter post-operative recovery time and a reduced risk of infection compared to traditional surgery, there are known risks associated with the use of LPMs, specifically in gynecologic surgeries. For example, current scientific evidence indicates that cancerous tissue may be present in uterine fibroids presumed to be benign (non-cancerous). When LPMs are used in surgeries where unsuspected cancerous tissue is present, there is a risk that morcellation could spread cancerous tissue throughout the body, decreasing a woman’s long-term survival.\nThe FDA has taken many actions over the years to ensure the safe and effective use of LPMs. Some of these actions include the issuance of a Safety Communication, holding a panel meeting to seek outside expert opinions, issuance of an FDA guidance recommending the addition of safety statements to the labeling for LPMs, and ensuring that up-to-date information regarding LPMs for gynecologic use is publicly available on the agency’s website.\nIn 2016, the FDA authorized the use of a first-of-kind tissue containment system, called the PneumoLiner, for use with certain LPMs to isolate uterine tissue that is not suspected to contain cancer. The device includes a containment bag where the tissue to be removed is placed in the bag and sealed such that morcellated tissue is not spread throughout the abdominal cavity during the morcellation process. Although the device effectively contains morcellated tissue, to ensure that the benefits of this device continued to outweigh the risks, this device was only authorized for use in specific patient populations, including women without uterine fibroids undergoing hysterectomy and pre-menopausal women with fibroids who wish to maintain their fertility. We also required specific warnings to be included in the labeling so that both patients and health care providers were aware of the risks of morcellation during certain gynecologic procedures.\nToday, we are providing marketing authorization for the PneumoLiner containment system with updated labeling. While the device itself remains unchanged since its prior marketing authorization, today’s clearance updates the labeling for this device to better define the appropriate patient population for the safe and effective use of this device, including stating that the device should only be used in women who have fibroids if they are pre-menopausal and under 50 years old. The likelihood of unsuspected cancer in women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy increases with age such that the benefit-risk profile of using LPMs is worse in older women when compared to younger women.\nIn addition to our efforts to ensure these devices are used in the appropriate patient population, as uncontained power morcellation has been associated with the spread of cancerous tissue, we are issuing draft guidance proposing to update our recommendations in the 2014 final guidance concerning the content and format of certain labeling information for LPMs. Specifically, the FDA is recommending that the labeling of LPMs include contraindications and warnings highlighting the following information regarding the risks of use of LPMs in gynecologic surgeries:\n\nThe risk of occult cancer, including uterine sarcoma, increases with age, particularly in women over 50 years of age. This information should be shared with patients when considering surgery with the use of these devices.\nUncontained power morcellation has been associated with the spread of benign uterine tissue, i.e., parasitic myomas and disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis.\nLaparoscopic power morcellators should only be used with a containment system. The containment system should be compatible with the laparoscopic power morcellator.\nLaparoscopic power morcellators are contraindicated in gynecologic surgery in which the tissue to be morcellated is known or suspected to contain malignancy.\nLaparoscopic power morcellators are contraindicated for removal of uterine tissue containing suspected fibroids in patients who are post-menopausal or over 50 years of age, or candidates for en bloc tissue removal through the vagina or via a mini-laparotomy incision.\n\nWe believe that the inclusion of accurate and detailed information in the labeling for LPMs, such as what is recommended in the draft guidance, will help both health care providers and patients understand the risks of using these devices, and aid in their decision to determine whether morcellation could be appropriate for them.\nFinally, today we are issuing an updated Safety Communication that provides important information to patients and health care providers on the risks associated with LPMs when used in certain gynecologic surgeries. This Safety Communication now recommends that an LPM only be used in certain surgeries with a containment system that is compatible with the LPM. This communication also contains recommendations for patients and health care providers if they are considering using LPMs for gynecologic surgery—such as discussing the risks and benefits of all available treatments options to determine whether morcellation is appropriate—and provides specific questions that patients can use to start a dialogue with their physician.\nEnsuring the safety of women’s health devices, including LPMs, remains a top priority for the agency. In taking these actions and making these recommendations, we considered available scientific information pertaining to the risk of spreading uterine tissue with uncontained power morcellation during gynecologic surgeries. We will continue to review information on laparoscopic power morcellation, including the latest data and evolving scientific literature, and are committed to continued communication to the public regarding our current thinking.\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

        "content": "UPDATE: On May 26, 2023, the FDA issued the final guidance: Non-Clinical Performance Assessment of Tissue Containment Systems Used During Power Morcellation Procedures. This final guidance provides recommendations to help manufacturers comply with the special controls related to non-clinical performance data for gynecologic and general use laparoscopic power morcellation containment systems (tissue containment systems), as well as other non-clinical testing recommendations to support a 510(k) submission. This final guidance document is focused on non-clinical performance testing; additional information, such as clinical data, may be needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence.\n\nLaparoscopic power morcellators are Class II medical devices used during laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgeries to cut tissue into smaller pieces so the tissue can be removed through a small incision site (typically 2 cm long or less).\nThese devices are commonly used in hysterectomy (surgical procedure to remove a woman's uterus) and myomectomy (surgical procedure to remove uterine fibroids which are noncancerous growths in a woman's uterus).\nLaparoscopic surgeries are associated with shorter post-operative recovery time and a reduced risk of infection compared to a hysterectomy or myomectomy done through an abdominal incision.\nOn this page:\n\nWhat Women and Their Health Care Providers Need to Know About Using Laparoscopic Power Morcellators to Treat Uterine Fibroids\nMaking Surgeries with Laparoscopic Power Morcellators Safer Through Tissue Containment Systems\nReporting Problems Related to Laparoscopic Power Morcellators and Laparoscopic Power Morcellator Tissue Containment Systems to the FDA\nContact Us\nResources on FDA Actions Related to Using Laparoscopic Power Morcellators to Treat Uterine Fibroids\n\n\nWhat Women and Their Health Care Providers Need to Know About Using Laparoscopic Power Morcellators to Treat Uterine Fibroids\nUterine sarcoma (a type of cancer) is more common in women undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids (noncancerous growths in a woman's uterus) than previously thought, and it can be hard to distinguish between a uterine sarcoma and a uterine fibroid before surgery with available tests. When laparoscopic power morcellators are used for myomectomy or hysterectomy in women with presumed uterine fibroids that are actually uterine sarcomas, the surgical procedure poses a risk of spreading cancerous tissue beyond the uterus, worsening a woman's chance of long-term survival.\nThe FDA estimates that a hidden uterine sarcoma may be present in approximately 1 in 225 to 1 in 580 women undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids based on published literature. The FDA also estimates that a leiomyosarcoma (a specific type of uterine sarcoma) may be present in approximately 1 in 495 to 1 in 1,100 women undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids based on recent studies. Before 2014, the clinical community estimated uterine sarcomas to be present much less often, in as few as 1 in 10,000 women undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids.\nSeveral studies show that using a laparoscopic power morcellator during gynecologic surgery in women with hidden uterine sarcomas is associated with lowering their chances of long-term survival without cancer. While these studies have limitations, women who have had fibroid surgery with a laparoscopic power morcellator later found to have a hidden uterine sarcoma, have lower disease-free survival (less time without any sign or symptom of cancer after surgery), when compared to women who were treated with manual morcellation or without morcellation. In addition, there are data to suggest an increase in rate of occult sarcoma (cancer that cannot be identified during pretreatment evaluation) for women undergoing surgery for presumed fibroids.\nThe FDA recommends health care providers share this information with patients and warn against using laparoscopic power morcellators in gynecologic surgeries to treat patients with suspected or confirmed cancer and in women over 50 years of age having a myomectomy or hysterectomy for uterine fibroids.\nUterine sarcomas and uterine fibroids may have similar signs and symptoms, so it may be difficult to determine whether cells are cancerous. At this time, there is no reliable method for predicting or determining whether a woman with fibroids may have a uterine sarcoma. Patients should talk with their health care provider about preoperative screening and whether using a laparoscopic power morcellator for their gynecologic surgery is appropriate for them.\nHealth care providers and informed patients can work together to choose the best treatment approach based on known risk factors for uterine sarcoma (for example, age, exposure to pelvic radiation therapy, prior use of the drug Tamoxifen, and race). For some patients, the benefits of minimally invasive surgery with a laparoscopic power morcellator may outweigh the risks. These patients may include some younger women who wish to maintain their fertility.\nMaking Surgeries with Laparoscopic Power Morcellators Safer Through Tissue Containment Systems\nThe FDA recommends that health care providers use tissue containment systems when using laparoscopic power morcellators, and that they ensure the laparoscopic power morcellator and tissue containment system are compatible. The FDA previously issued the guidance, Product Labeling for Laparoscopic Power Morcellators recommending that laparoscopic power morcellator labeling include a statement that the device should only be used with a containment system.\nThe FDA granted marketing authorization for tissue containment systems that are intended for use during gynecologic laparoscopic surgery and tissue containment systems that are intended for use during general laparoscopic surgery. The FDA issued the final guidance on Non-Clinical Performance Assessment of Tissue Containment Systems Used During Power Morcellation Procedures to provide recommendations on non-clinical testing information to include in a premarket submissions. Laparoscopic power morcellation tissue containment systems are intended to isolate and contain tissue that is considered benign (noncancerous). Based on non-clinical testing, use of a tissue containment system confines morcellated tissue within the containment system.\nUse of laparoscopic power morcellators allows for minimally invasive surgical procedures, which, when compared to open abdominal surgery, typically reduce the risk of infection and shorten the post-operative recovery period. However, when used in myomectomy or hysterectomy procedures, there is an increased risk of spreading unsuspected cancer and benign tissue within the abdomen and pelvis. The risk of unsuspected cancer increases with age, particularly in women over 50 years of age.\nBecause of this increased risk, the FDA recommends use of laparoscopic power morcellation only in appropriately selected women undergoing myomectomy or hysterectomy and only if a tissue containment system is used. See the UPDATE: Perform Only Contained Morcellation When Laparoscopic Power Morcellation Is Appropriate: FDA Safety Communication for more patient and health care provider recommendations.\nTo find more information about FDA-cleared tissue containment systems for gynecologic or general laparoscopic surgery, go to the De Novo database or the 510(k) Premarket Notification database, type PMU or PZQ in the Product Code field and click Search.\nReporting Problems Related to Laparoscopic Power Morcellators and Laparoscopic Power Morcellators Tissue Containment Systems to the FDA\nThe FDA encourages patients, health care providers, and manufacturers to continue to report events associated with laparoscopic power morcellators and laparoscopic power morcellator tissue containment systems to the Agency. This information helps the FDA monitor the safety of marketed medical devices.\nIf you suspect a problem resulting from the use of a laparoscopic power morcellator or a laparoscopic power morcellator tissue containment system, we encourage you to file a voluntary report through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program.\nHealth care personnel employed by facilities that are subject to the FDA's user facility reporting requirements should follow the reporting procedures established by their facilities.\nDevice manufacturers must comply with the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations.\nContact Us\nIf you have questions about this issue, please contact the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) at DICE@FDA.HHS.GOV, 800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100.\nResources on FDA Actions Related to Using Laparoscopic Power Morcellators\n\nFinal Guidance: Product Labeling for Laparoscopic Power Morcellators\nFDA In Brief: FDA Takes Additional Actions to Increase the Safety of Laparoscopic Power Morcellators Used in Gynecologic Surgeries\n2020 Updated Safety Communication: Perform Only Contained Morcellation When Laparoscopic Power Morcellation Is Appropriate\n2020 Updated Safety Communication: The FDA recommends performing contained morcellation in women when laparoscopic power morcellation is appropriate\nFDA Statement: FDA Takes New Steps to Increase the Safety of Laparoscopic Power Morcellators when used in Gynecologic Surgeries\n510(k) Summary More-Cell-System\n510(k) Summary PneumoLiner\nDe Novo Summary PneumoLiner\nDe Novo Summary ContainOR\n2014 Safety Communication\n2014 Meeting Materials of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel\n2014 FDA Executive Summary from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel"
