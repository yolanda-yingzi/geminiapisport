The FDA is also recommending that the labeling of LPMs include contraindications and warnings highlighting the risks of use of LPMs in gynecologic surgeries, including the risk of occult cancer, the risk of spreading benign uterine tissue, and the contraindication of LPMs in gynecologic surgery in which the tissue to be morcellated is known or suspected to contain cancer.",
