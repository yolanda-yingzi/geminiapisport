      "text_input": "What causes stress urinary incontinence (SUI)?",
      "output": "SUI occurs when the pelvic tissues and muscles supporting the bladder and urethra weaken, allowing the bladder 'neck' to descend and preventing the urethra from working properly. It can also happen due to a weakened sphincter muscle, which is unable to control urine flow under normal circumstances or increased abdominal pressure. Factors like pregnancy, childbirth, aging, or prior pelvic surgery can weaken these muscles.",

      "text_input": "What are the non-surgical treatment options for SUI?",
      "output": "Non-surgical treatment options for SUI include: pelvic floor exercises (Kegel exercises) to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, pessary (a removable device inserted into the vagina to support the bladder neck), and transurethral bulking agents (collagen injections around the urethra to thicken the surrounding space and reduce urine leakage).",

      "output": "Before deciding on SUI surgery, ask your surgeon about all available treatment options, including both surgical and non-surgical, and the reasons behind their recommendation. Inquire about their specialized training in surgical treatment. Discuss the potential risks and complications of surgery, including the possibility of additional surgery and the specific risks associated with mesh slings, such as vaginal mesh erosion and penile irritation/pain.",
