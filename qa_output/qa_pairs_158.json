      "output": "Medication Guides are required for certain prescription drugs when the FDA determines that patient labeling could help prevent serious adverse reactions, the drug has serious risk(s) (relative to benefits) of which patients should be made aware, or patient adherence to directions for use is crucial to the drug’s effectiveness. PPIs are part of the FDA-approved prescription drug labeling for oral contraceptives and estrogen-containing products, and are required to be dispensed with each prescription. Manufacturers may voluntarily submit PPIs for other prescription drugs for FDA approval, but their distribution is not mandated.",
